0, Considering this was shot in 1972 the video quality is excellent (4:3). Nice sharp (close-up) images with longer shots a little muddled as to be expected with only a few spotlights running during the show. Audio is in its original stereo and sounds OK to pretty good. The performance is stellar but a little short (64 Minutes). It's got a really cool trippy film section about half way through. Far-out. If you like the music of Traffic - get it while you can.
1, ok, I know its just random, but it seems like its reading my mind. I asked if I was going to shake again, knowing i was going to, and tada! it said a full-on yes. also, I asked, does so-and-so like me? and it said definately not. a shook again, asking, are you sure? and it said, yes.  it also has over 35 answers from what I gather. one of the greatest apps EVER!!!-Stephan&iexcl;e Frost.
2, Have used this for 5 months and have seen a difference. I have sensitive skin and use hypoallergenic so I buy the fragrance free style. It actually does as advertised. I am very impressed. I am 64 and have seen a noticeable improvement in texture.  It is worth trying and the price is reasonable compared to other products. I have never used Olay products before, and am thrilled to find these results at such a reasonable price. I use it with their Pro X scrub and small white brush that spins. Together, with a few other of their Regenerist products, and WOW!
3, This app is good but I uninstallled because the way I am eating, my calorie count would never be quite right. For instance I made grilled chicken tenders and a macaroni salad. Because my macaroni salad is not listed on the app I can either pick a different one and hope its right or I input ever single item in my salad and try to guess how much of a serving I had. To much work and with my weight loss challenge I want accuracy and a complete program. I don't think I can do that with this.
4, Yes, I believe they got it right this time, too.  My first experience with the Supremes was spring of '62(?) with "Let Me Go the Right Way".  (I'm glad it's on this package).  I thought, "Yeah, let's hear more of THEM" but I didn't hear anymore for some reason until "Where Did Our Love Go?", the one that really launched the group considerably later. (Mary Wells was the biggest Motowner until then).  Although there is some filler here, I cannot remember seeing so many HITS on one compilation unless it was from the MUCH LONGER career of Ray Charles.  This seems like the one to have, don't you think?  No, really.
5, The end that plugs into the device, it not at a right angle, it stick out, and when wearing my phone on my waist the wire is being pulled upward.  Needless to say, about 5 weeks after receiving them the wire inside the connector, or rater right where it sticks out, broke.  Wiggle it just right and I get sound in both earns, if not only 1 ear gets sound.  I returned these for credit and bought a pair of Motorola S305 Bluetooth headphones, and I could not be happier.  Skip this product, you'll thank me later once you did.
6, I heard the book was better but I found the documentary somewhat engaging. They talked about incentives, how names that were hot are now for the lower working classes, cheating, why crime has dropped and so forth. The most interesting part to me was about how names that were for the upper classes have since dropped to the lower middle classes and also whether your name can affect your economic life. I had expected more interesting tidbits so what I expected to be excellent turned out to be only somewhat good. WHEN WATCHED: late August 2011; MY GRADE: B minus.
7, Years ago, when wrinkle development bothered me, I researched and decided on Olay daily serum. Been getting regularly via Subscribe and Save, which helps w/cost and convenience.My skin is 60+ yrs old and sensitive. Stuff I've used in the past suddenly causes skin reactions, but NOT the Olay Daily Serum. It' goes on smoothly, takes only a few 'squirts' for complete face/neck coverage. No smell, and after about 10 minutes of soaking in, ready for makeup, if needed.There is no sun protection w/this, so if that's a concern, it's not for you. Also, if you're looking for wrinkle reduction, there's better but more expensive. Wrinkles are a fact of life, so my reaction to them was easier/cheaper to adjust than continuing a fruitless search for the perfect serum.
8, The title says it all.  One of the very last Motown albums to be recorded in Detroit, before Berry Gordy took the label to LA.  Perhaps the saddest of all music deaths was the night back in 1984 when I heard on my car radio that Marvin was shot by, of all people, his father.  His dad, a Reverend, a man of GOD.  Marvin dedicated this album to the man who would kill him 13 years later.This is probably the most haunting piece of music from the 20th Century, and therefore it is truly timeless.  That's why it will always sound as if it were recorded last night.  I can't listen to the title track without tears.  Neither can you.
9, Pros: The product looks very sleek, and is very useful. I used the build-in laser pointer for my presentation. Flash light looks useful as well, but I didn't have a chance to use it yet, maybe when blackout or go camping.The battery is very sufficient for my iPhone. I fully charged my iPhone 4s and still had plenty of Battery left. I like its portability: small size + light weight.Cons: Should come with AC adapter (Wall charger). The flash light should be brighter, otherwise it is gonna be useless.5 out of 5 Stars !!
10, Don't get me wrong - I love the Beatles more than anyone. My comments are more about the DVD than the movie itself (which is still pretty bad, but, they were wasted). The company who made this DVD did a terrible job. The  video is &quot;dirty&quot; and full of &quot;short hairs.&quot; It looks  worse than a VHS tape played 100 times. Don't make this your first Beatles  video purchase; make it your last. And don't knock me because I think it  sucks - I'm telling the truth.
11, I bought one of these for those occasional trips to the mountains, and found it to be one of the better brush/scrapers I have ever had...especially when the low price is considered.The brush is soft and easily moves snow from a windshield. The handle is long enough to reach well past the middle of my SUV, and the foam handle is a nice touch, especially on those cold mornings when I forgot my gloves.The ice scraper also has a nice edge to it, and is comfortable to hold by using the brush end as a handle.In summary, this is one of the better snow/ice scrapers I have ever owned, and is comfortable to use. It seems very well made, and I'd be surprised if it doesn't last for a few years. I would have preferred a brighter color, mine was blue/black. I'd much rather a bright read as it can be easier to find if dropped in snow. Other than that, very happy.
12, We started out with the Size 1 AVENT nipple and then when our son was around two months we switched to size 2 and once he got to be around 3.5 we moved him to size 3. It definitely has a faster flow than size 2 and he is able to take his bottle a lot faster. It took him a little time to get used to the faster flow, but he does fine with it now (five months old). I don't plan to move up to a size 4, I'll just stick with the size 3 until he is weaned. Our son is exclusively formula fed.
13, I got hooked and watched all of season one only to find out that there's no season two... so, in the end you're left hanging.  That being said, this is a very entertaining series with very interesting characters, and premise.I found it a bit odd that there was nothing particularly remarkable about the "others", they don't seem to have any special powers so it's hard to think of them as aliens per se.The one thing that bugged me a bit was how the characters managed to get from place to place covering great distances in no time at all.  That was completely unbelievable considering they used conventional transportation, but maybe it's just me that it bugs.To sum up:  this is a nice sci-fi drama that got cut short in the end.
14, this is a good srv vhs. i own it. its one of my favorites' but ya know with mr vaughan you can never go wrong is the king. him and jimi hendrix both rule. some compare him to hendrix but i never do cause there both great artists in all they did. i love the videos on here i guess my favorite is cold shot and then commit a crime. love em all though. but one thought i have keeps comeing back to me seeing as to the name of this vhs is pride and joy shouldnt that one have been on here to? just a thought
15, Like others, I had initial issues getting hooked on this critically acclaimed novel, especially as I had just read my way through a glut of scifi page turners. In short, it takes some gear switching but if you enjoy hard scifi & exemplary writing, Red Mars is worth your time.  Once I relaxed into the slow rhythms of the story, I was simply awed.  So much so, I ended up reading the whole trilogy and enjoyed each successive book more than the last.  Immensely satisfying read.
16, I tried other methods for keeping track of my food intake and exercise. None worked well or smoothly. This product is simple to use and sync with my computer for later printing of reports and graphs. Only improvement I would recommend would be to include more of the equipment typically found in most gyms. When I looked through exercise tab listing I was surprised that it did not include treadmills. That aside, I would recommend this to anyone who hates counting calories but needs a quick tracking device. Works great on the Kindle Fire!
17, If you enjoyed the girl groups of the early 1960's this video is a must for you.  Chances are very good the songs you enjoyed girl groups sing are included here.  Ronnie Spector and The Ronettes singing Be My Baby is worth the price in itself.  The 1960's was a time of great music, and a large number of those memorable songs came from the girl groups.  I'm planning on using this video in my after school class of 5th-7th graders after we sing a number of the songs.  I know they will enjoy it.
18, I have not seen these toons in a while. The last time I watched these toons on cable, they were hacked up and censored, mainly due to the racist humor in them. For example in 'Magical Maestro' an ink pen is squirted onto Poochini and transformed in a &quot;black faced&quot; performer. Well I was glad to see the cartoons on this tape were not touched by the censors, and everything is in tact!This is a must for any Tex Avery fan, I plan on purchasing the next volumes in this series.I would loved to have seen it on DVD :) (hint hint)
19, I couldn't get into The Wire, despite hearing about Idris and his acting excellence, but when I saw that Ruth Wilson was on this show too, I took the bait.  I've now watched the first season three times (something I never do) and I'm having a hard time holding off on restarting season two, as I want to save it as a precursor to this year's season three release.If you like good television, acting, writing, stories -- hell if you just like good things -- watch. this. show.
20, Just another rip-off as it does nothing good at all. I used it faithfully for weeks, both with a night cream as well, and take two showers or baths per day to keep everything clean and moisturized. I think people that say it works well, are those that see what they WANT to SEE and nothing more. The tiny, tiny little bit of good that happens if any, is the same that can be accomplished with any moisturizer, and not the expensive stuff that delivers nothing THE ONLY THING THAT DISAPPEARS HERE IS OUR CASH AND NOTHING MORE.
21, This movie contains a collection of characters that seem impossible in real life even if I actually do think they exist.  I do wonder how many find each other.  While this may be a passable comedy, it wasn't very entertaining.  I found myself cringing when the Paul Dano character holds up a bra as if seeing if it fit. His door is open at his college office.  Now you just know he's going to be found out.  That whole cross-dressing story line seemed terribly unnecessary.  The real focus should have been on Henry played nicely by Kevin Kline.  He was interesting.  Katie Holmes, making a rare appearance as an actress since she became a mommy, plays her small role with low key elegance.  The movie, while a modest time waster, is well made from a production standpoint.  Just not my cup of tea.
22, Most diaper caddies out there for your changing table take up valuable table space, so this really appealed to me since it "hangs" over the edge of the table. Mine came cracked, and I didn't have the patience to send it back and get another one, as my baby was due soon and I wanted one less thing to worry about. It looks nice and works well, gets the job done. The only thing I worry about is putting a full box of wipes in it, as I'm afraid it will completely break since it's already cracked. I don't know how it got cracked as the box it came in was in fine condition. Room for diapers, wipes, diaper cream, lotion & more. Would definitely recommend to all parents of newborns.
23, I actually used this with my Pack N Play and loved the handy organizer features.  I moved it to my changing table after discovering I could order one of those Pack N Play Parent Organizers as a replacement part (even from another company's product!) which worked much nicer with my play yard.  Still - this item was very handy.  Note: it only fits on the "front" of a changing table or play yard (the attachment arm/hook is not wide enough to hang from the sides).Update at 1 yr: still using this item.  A good buy & fit on the pack-n-play but also on the changing table late on.
24, Well, there is one first thing to say about this book: it is good, but not worth all the expectation.It just seems that Mr. Martin spent years writing about all these eventualities of life of the characters. Somehow, he lost more time describing interesting situations (but less important) than the details relevant to the plot.Much of the book is used to describe the world in its details, whether with people or places. He lacked, however, go further in the plot. The drama that takes place in Meereen is a metaphor for all the big process in the writing of this book. As Daenerys has difficulty leaving the place and can never create anything new, Martin is lost in the fifth book.Not that Dance with Dragons is bad. It is very good, but simply does not meet all the expectations and falls far short of the first three books.
25, This looked like an interesting and relatively low-cost option for my wife's car/cell phone, since she hasn't found a bluetooth headset that fits her ear comfortably.  Unfortunately, we cannot get this unit to pair with any of three cell phones (iPhone 3G, two new Nokias).  It goes into pairing mode as advertised, but none of our phones can find it (they all find all of the headsets and computers we have tried pairing with other than this unit).  Makes this rather useless, and I would strongly suggest testing your phone against one of these before ordering.Also disappointed in the lack of a USB or AC charger.  My fault for not noticing that this only comes with a car charger - not very convenient for how we typically charge.No issues with the merchant - quickly shipped and delivered just fine.  The low rating here is about the speakerphone, not the merchant.
26, I finished rereading &#34;Little Big Man&#34; and decided to re-read &#34;Flashman and the Redskins,&#34; which covers some of the same ground in the second half of the book.[It would have been very interesting to have Flashman and Jack Crabb meet.] I've enjoyed all the Flashman books and was sorry when the author died several years ago. This novel covers events roughly twenty-five years apart - the California Gold Rush and Custer's Last Stand. Of course Flashman meets the greats and near-greats in his travels - everyone from Geronimo and Crazy Horse to Kit Carson and Custer. Flashman has no illusions about himself and honestly reports on all his misdeeds, which usually occur because he's covering his own rear end. I recommend all the Flashman novels. They're very entertaining and you'll learn a little history. My only regret in this book is that Flashman mentions his Civil War adventures when he fought for both the North AND the South and that book never got written.
27, I was fortunate to find two of these gates with two extensions each at a second hand baby store for 20 dollars each.  After the first year with my newborn, I've come to need a coupe more gates.  I have tried 4 other similar ones and quickly sent them back.  These ones are a little more expensive, but I've found that after being spoiled with the foot opening contraption of these gates, I simply cannot live without that feature in another gate.  I do need the extensions, which makes it more expensive, so I will be purchasing two more of these in the very near future!!
28, Furnace is one of my favorte reads.  Ms. Gray captures a great hero in this book.  You understand him and what makes him tick.  She also captures the area that this book takes place in very well.  Even though she doesn't  name &quot;real&quot; places or people, I knew where she was, because I  grew up in that area off of Interstate 81.  Ms. Gray did a wonderful job of  making her people and places come alive.  She has a great understanding of  the &quot;back&quot; area of rural Virginia.  The plot was good.  Reminded  me of the old movie &quot;Curse of the Demon&quot;, but taken further in  plot.  She surprised me several times.  Her sub-plotting kept me on the  edge of my seat too.  Very good read.
29, I purchased this product!! I've tried many, many products in hopes something could help my nails grow, stop the tremendous peeling, and breakage right at my quick. This was my last resort and when reading the reviews I really thought to myself, whatever we'll see. I've never seen anything like. It's so amazing that I bought this very brand names polishes and my nails have never looked better!! No more acrylics!! YEEEAAAAH!! I am forever going to by this product and couldn't be happier. - Shelby, GA
30, This is the best Beatles movie it makes a lot of sense and all fans need to roll up to it and let it take you away.  It's truely amazing and the most like yellow Submarine as far as the fact that every time you rewind  you see something that wasn't there the last time.  Fool on the hill is the  realest part and flying will get you.  A must have for anyone interested in  the beatles psycadelic era that describes the reasons behind Sgt. pepperes  Lonly Harts Club Band Album.
31, This polish is easy to use and it gives excellent results. I don't use it in my car because it makes it look darker, so I use a paint cleaner and then wax, but if you don't want to spend a lot of time detailing your vehicle, go for it. It also lasts a long time -and keep in mind that it has to cure, at least, a week or so. It is normal to see some streaks at first, but they'll go away. It leaves the paint very shiny.
32, Marvin Gaye's 'What's Goin On' is one of those albums so warm, inviting and engaging that its draws you in from your first listen and begs to me replayed. From the genre-defining, perfectly soul-pop of the title track, which shows off Gaye's fantastic voice to its best, to the free-flowing jazzy epic 'Right On' and the stark, closing 'Inner City Blues', this is a real masterwork.It is a beautiful, flowing masterpiece of a work; fitting together so perfectly. This is the kind of album for every person, even those who don't like soul generally, calling to mind hopes, dreams and love. The lyrics are also both socio-political (What's Goin On, Mercy Mercy Me) and religious (God Is Love, Wholly Holy). Gaye also shows off his worth as a brilliant producer. No collection is complete without this album.
33, I have been trying lots of these facial products that are sold at CVS/Walmart type stores. So far, Olay and Aveeno are the only brands that consistently work. The effects of this serum are very subtle, but they ARE noticeable. It tends to just soften the look of your skin over all, and while it doesnt affect deep wrinkles, it does help minimize smaller ones. I also have skin that is very prone to break outs, and this has amazingly never caused any! Over all, for me it is definitely worth the money.
34, Robinson's Mars series is one of those rare SF novels (and yes, despite being 3 books long, it forms a single novel) that breaks the bounds of the genre and can hold its own in the general arena. In other words, one does not have to be a science-fiction fan to enjoy it. It explores the human condition and the universe as well, and the relationship of the two, through the eyes of some of the most beautifully developed characters to be found in all of literature. It is both cosmic and very, very human in its scope.While I greatly enjoy SF, Robinson sets the bar higher for a genre that is often too comfortable in its niche. He looks at where we are going, and points to a bright future--one that is possible to achieve if we have the heart to try.
35, This app has really helped me to keep track of what I'm eating.  It's got a whole bunch of foods already listed and it's very user friendly to use if you must insert your own foods.  I've already noticed I pay more attention to what I have instead of what I'd normally get without being conscious of the calories and other nutritional values.  The only thing I wish they would do a better job of is with the workout portion.  It's difficult to use that portion unless you know what the strength training exercises are called.  I use the machines but don't know all the names of the exercises!  But regardless of that, this app is very helpful and I'd definitely recommend using this if you are reluctant to join one of the many diets or fitness fads. It works great on the Fire!
36, When episode 1 first opens, I was wondering what the heck is this? It shows old photos of a hospital in London, the captions tell us that 1 in 7 children died during the turn of the century, most people did not live past 45 - and, the list goes on. Then the story begins. I was glued to the screen. Between the fast pace, the getting to know the characters, the information about our medical history, and so on - I stayed up half the night watching half of the first season. I love this show and hope there are more to come.
37, Really wanted to like this show; love the 4 gals they brought together; Wendy Malik & Jeane Leves in particular from Frazier, and the amazing Betty White you figure it can't miss right? Well, you can. Its the typical scenerio, bring comedy  'All Stars' together and it SHOULD be awesome/hilarious, and it just isn't. Frazier, Just Shoot Me, and Wings were all 8--10 comedy shows in my book, but this new show rated at best, a '2' for me. So bummed! But just like when Kelsey Grammer went from Frazier to his next show "Back to You" (which I thought was hilarious but was a "1 and done" season follow up) it takes more than 'Stars' to make a great show. I bought this brand new and wish I hadn't--cause in a short time it will be for sale used on Amazon for less than half price cause its not very funny--that's my take.
38, 2PAC is my favourite rapper of all time (and i aint riding anything).... this brotha could do no wrong.... he was a actor, poet, activist, hell of a dancer, and a influence to every single rapper on the face of this earth... PERIOD....this double disc was different at the time... no rapper put out a double disc... that was wierd at the time (now every1 is releaseing a double disc from outkast to britney spears, from nas to even lil' flip...my favourite tracks are 'all about u'w/ nate dogg, 'holla at me', 'how do you want it', 'california love', 'ambitionz az a ridah', and 'life goes on' this whole album is off the chain.if you like true hip hop and not this crap on the radio... pick this CLASSIC album up and learn something...the greatest....5 out of 5 stars
39, This is probably the simplest, cheapest and most effective way for people to loose weight.........I am sure none of the companies who are making millions off diet products and supplements and plans will admit it though! This is a GREAT app........all you do is input what you eat every day.........I have never had a problem finding a food item, home made, store bought, fast food, restaurant, brand or generic. All the nutritional information comes up, and you get a great record day by day, weekly summaries,. It is medically proven that simply setting a goal and tracking your intake is a VERY effective method of losing weight. If you have your phone with you 24/7 anyway, why not let it help you get healthy?  I lost 35 pounds in the first six months using this app religiously..............and I am hooked on it now!
40, I Only rate this item 4 Stars because I just purchased it today.  It was very simple to assemble, I didnt even need my husband for help.  We purchased this gate because of the great reviews and also because I have 2 70lbs Terriers that need to start getting used to being guarded off.  Although Im only 6 months pregnant I know this gate is going to work out great for our dogs when our baby is here.  We've had it up all day and the dogs jump on it with no problem.  The gate is sturdy comfy and attractive as well which is important in my house, most of all seems very safe. I highly recommend this product for all parent who have dogs in their house no matter what size they are.I would be giving it 5 stars if I had this gate longer,  but couldnt wait to post the great review after purchasing it and seeing how great my dogs are adapting to it.
41, This is a great app, it tracks everything well and it is super easy to use. I love that you can see the daily summary of how many grams protein you had, how much calcium, etc. The only thing I wish was a little better is the part that lets you input your own foods and how many calories it is. I thought I would be able to put in my ingredients in the recipe and then it can calculate everything outsell but you have to know how much it is before. If they can do it so that you input the ingredients and it is automatic, then it would be fantastic.
42, This Video is fantastic.Most of the Carpenters hits are in this collection. The sad part is seeing Karen so thin in one video,then looking great in another one.Even Richard looked bad around 1975,singing one of my  favorites,&quot;Only Yesterday.&quot; The best Karen looked on this tape  was in 1977,two years after almost dying singing&quot;All you get from Love  is a Love song.&quot;I never seen her look so sexy and full of life.She was  on her way to a full recovery.This video collection's wonderfull. We get to  see the Carpenters from early TV specials,to the last video's the  Carpenters recorded for the&quot;Made in America&quot;Album. Karen was in  bad shape,and her eyes lost that glow.Its very sad to watch these last  video's made by the Carpenters.One Video I would love to have is the  Carpenters Christmas Special. I hope this comes out in the near future.I  would love to have it along with this great video.
43, I have a 1999 stratus the finish still gets compliments like-- I cant believe your car is 15 years old.  And the car was never parked in a garage either....its been outside in the North East for 15 years.  I never bought any other product.It does make a mess on black plastic trim.. Their web site says to use mineral spirits but I use Mother's back to black. Mother's does not remove the haze entirely but hides it for a few weeks. After the second or third coat of Mother's the haze is gone.  I am going to try an electric toothbrush next time
44, I previously used a bosch wiper blade with brackets and noticed that it was starting to streak. When I went to check the blade, I noticed that the entire wiper blade was coming off the hook and it was barely holding on. How dangerous is that? Not only could it have hurt someone if it came off, I could've put myself and other vehicles at risk if it did fall off when it was raining.The direct connect system which snaps shut to ensure that the blade will not wiggle off provided me ease of mind and the design of a spoiler to increase contact to the windshield wiper while you are driving.. Brilliant! No streaking so far and it is quiet on my 2005 Corolla S. Its a great investment because the bracketed wiper blades are obsolete compared to this.
45, I purchased this gate at Babies R Us, but read the reviews first from Amazon.  I just purchased a toddler bed for my child and the gate is used to keep her in her bedroom at night.  The gate was so easy to put together and fits perfectly at the entrance of her bedroom door.  To open it, all you do is step on the foot pedal, which is needs weight to open.  The only problem I have now, is that my child closes the gate all the time.  When it's suppose to stay open.  Oh, well!!
46, I didn't know this was what was already on my car when I bought another to replace it. After removing the cap I found moisture had made its way into the components inside, under the cap. I would take an educated guess that it was due to an inferior o-ring or bad vent cap that came with the cap, see my other review. There was some oxidation on various parts and even some rust, which I've never seen in any other vehicles I've owned over the past 20 yrs. This rotor was a PITA to remove! Due to the lousy cap, the rotor was rusted on and had to be cut off. Even after installing the new one, I tried to remove it just out of curiosity and it was very hard to remove. I've never had this problem with OEM parts. I won't buy this rotor or the matching cap again.
47, I've had the watch for about a month.  I like the styling, though a mix of silver and gold would be better.  The watch is quite heavy, but that is not very noticeable during a busy day.  The bracelet and clasp are sturdy and the clasp does not pop open.The digital numbers are hard to read from about 20 after to about 20 'til because the minute hand is over the numbers.  This is worse when the hour hand is in the same area.  This doesn't prevent you from telling the time but can be annoying.I also own a Timex Ironman Triathlon watch with a plastic band.  I thought the button layout on this watch would be similar, but there is more difference than I expected.  The alarmon this watch is not as loud nor does it beep as frequently.Overall I am happy with the purchase and would do it again.
48, Prince has long been regarded by critics and fans as one of the most engaging live performers on the planet, and he lives up to, and goes beyond, what we ever thought him capable of in this film.  He sings, dances, screams, writhes, entices, flirts, splits and smirks his way through almost all of his Magnum Opus Sign 'O' The Times, and not a second of it is the least bit superfluous or tiresome.  Let me put it very simply.  If you want to see the greatest pure musician living today doing what he does best at the height of his powers, then you must buy this film.
49, I have have purchased two pairs of these headphones in the past 3 years.  The first pair was replaced twice through the warranty.  Both times it was for the exact same problem: it would lose the sound in one of the channels.  This was caused by the weak connection between the 3.5mm jack and the cord.  If that cord got bent around at all, which is unavoidable, it would eventually short out one of the stereo channels.  Luckily the headphones come with a very good warranty and they replaced them both times.  The third time it happened I just bought another pair.On the the headphones performance: The sound is excellent and the noise isolation even better.  You can block out the rest of the world easily; which is very good since I ride a noisy commuter train every day.  The inline iPhone/smart phone controls work wonderfully.  The microphone in the headset does a very good job of picking up my voice and blocking out background noise.
50, Does exactly what I would expect.  It just works!  Easy to pair with my Blackberry 8830, plenty of volume from the speaker.  People I call do not complain about voice quality so must be good enough!  Only slight negative is only included charging solution is a 12V car charger but Amazon does have a AC to 12V converter for about $12.  So far I have not bought it, claimed stand by time of 200 hours seems real so do not have to charge very often.  Auto shut off after 15 minutes of no blue-tooth connect helps save the battery.
51, I already owned an external battery from this company.  Had it two years and it's still working great so when I saw they had a smaller unit, I bought two.  These are smaller than my iPhone and iPod Touch and fits perfect in my travel purse.Likes-Portablity, comes with a small black drawstring bag.-Size, fits in my smallest purse, easy to tavel with.-Battery standby life on this battery is awesome.-Charges my iPhone and Galaxy Player faster than the computer and car charger.-Charges my dead iPhone 2x's while using the phone, probably more if I didn't use (surfing, talking, etc) it while charging.Dislikes-Power button easily depressed when in my purse, so I found a cushioned case to keep that from happening.-Adapters, charges with a micro usb cable, it ships with that and cables but there not dedicated, there's an adapter included for that.  But accessories are easily found at Walmart or online.This is a great addition to tech family.
52, This product definitely provides unsurpassed protection. I have two small complaints. First, the plastic inner cover does not have a hole for the camera. So the pictures look blurry through the plastic. But you don't really have to put the plastic on, like the manufacturer suggests. Second, it is a little too bulky. But I'm getting used to it. All and all, it is a good product. One last thing, if you are looking at this particular OtterBox, there is another one by a different seller for almost $20 cheaper. I wish I had seen the other one. Oh well.
53, I hate this comb. I have 4C hair that is &#34;natural&#34; that is really thick and longer but still this comb is terrible. It snags and feels like it is going to break with each use. If you are very, very, very careful and slow you have nothing to worry about. So maybe if you are detangling after a good wash or deep condition this might be of some use but for me I don't even use this comb anymore as it pulls out my hair and is big and not sturdy. A well built wide tooth comb would be better, I will not be buying this product again. It is useless and just sits under my sink after I have found my old wide tooth hand comb. Doesn't work well with my daughter's hair either though her curls are not as rough as mine and silkier.
54, This is a particularly bad film, so if you are new to MST3K, steer clear until you get a few more episodes under your belt. Also, just so you realize the amount of pain and suffering the MST3K crew had to go through, you need to understand that they watch the movie over and over and over so they can script their riffs. You are only forced to watch it once; they are forced to watch it several times. Just thinking of watching this movie without the riffing hurts me badly.
55, As any reviewer can tell you,Innervision reputation preceeds the 1973 masterpiece.The newly remastered version(8 of the 9 tracks appears in remastered form on At the Close Of A Century box set)also includes a better packaging job compared to its first pressing as well as superior sound quality that makes this sounds like listening to it for the first time all over again.Like the rest of his 70s masterpieces(Music Of My Mind,Talking Book,Fullfillingness...)this remastering project give his music the respect that it has always accorded with the sound quality it deserves.
56, We put it in a doorway that we walk through constantly, I can open it with no hands (i.e. holding the baby)  It keeps out the dog (about 65 pounder) and withstands some jail bar style shaking from my 1 year old.  I can leave the gate open, walking through is a bit narrow for my wide hips, but I don't have to turn sideways or anything.Get it, you won't regret it.  looks nice, easy to install, keeps out the dog and the baby in!
57, Despite Broadway and New York critics falling all over themselves in search of superlatives to capture Diana at another one of her career peaks, The Grammys chose once again to look the other way. After ignoring her superb work on the #1, American Music Award winning soundtrack for &#34;[[Lady Sings the Blues]]&#34; when Linda Ronstadt was celebrated in the early 80s for her Nelson Riddle Orchestra covers albums and Natalie Cole's &#34;[[Unforgettable]]&#34; in the 90s and Streisand's Broadway albums, &#34;[[An Evening With Diana Ross]]&#34; showed a continued disrespect for her artistry. And its a shame because once again, the lady is at the top of her game melding pop, jazz, R&B and Broadway on one project.
58, No spoilers hereThe books go downhill all the way, so don't expect much of this one. I became a fan with the first and I'm trying to still be a fan, but it's really hard.Expect each chapter to go into details of superfulous things, to be repeatable, and, worst of all, boring. In this last book the author has started to spend a lot of words in useless drama and finishing the chapter when something really happens. Then he skips all the things that happened so you go forward in time to when someone is remembering what happened. Boring and tedious.Another important thing is that the author also goes to the next level in sexual references. And the repetitive use of phrases and words also is tiresome.If you find a book that summirizes this one, get it. This book can be made to two pages per chapter easily. The rest is useless... and boring boring boring.
59, This show is worth watching. It only gets better as the seasons continue to build on a fantastically built foundation. It gives a fun plot each week, but what really holds it together is the amazing, personal character driven plots that underpin the series, bonding us to the show. You don't just love the stories of what the characters do, but who the characters are. The writters do a great job of growing these characters and letting us get to know them (& love them) more & more.
60, This is a beautiful and wonderful chain!  It was exactly what I was looking for and looks fantastic around my neck!  I wanted a  somewhat thicker chain than the one that I bought at a store when I bought the charms that hang on it.  A thicker chain gives much more support to the three (children's birthstones) charms that I have on it.  In fact, the other chain that came from the store, is a replacement for the original one I bought that broke while on my neck!  I was super lucky that I didn't lose my charms when that happened!  This chain has given no need for concern in that matter!!!  Highly recommended!
61, Neither of these chargers worked with any of the ipods in our house -- not the iPod touch, not the iPhone, and not the iPod Classics.It has been my experience with off-brand chargers that sometimes they will actually be charging even though the charge light does not light and sometimes that the item will work if you wiggle the connection or throw salt over your shoulder while attempting to get it to work.  Nothing made these work.I left each item connected for between 8-24 hours, each, to find out if any of the ipods charged and they didn't.
62, I purchased this armoire based on the positive comments from other buyers. I was very disappointed at the very cheap quality of the drawers. When you pull them out far enough to have a glimse of the items in the back compartments, the drawer just falls out. If you ever want to see items stored towards the back of the drawers you will have to pull the drawer out entirely. Very cheap workmanship. Not worth it. If you are a prospective buyer, I'd go for one of the more expensive and durable models.
63, While this Cd does not have all of my favorite Rick James jams on it, it has enough to make it worth the purchase!Some of the cds highlights for me are Give it to me baby... Ghetto Life.. Make love ot me..Super Freak..Fire & Desire... and Below the funk! Really every song is great..and its a pure FUNK session with one of the greatest artist..musicians to ever live .I am happy with my purchase, and plan to purchase another Rick James cd  or several more in the future, just to have a nice assortment of all his hits, and even some songs that weren't considered a huge commercial success but lovely none the less! Buy it!
64, This is Pink Floyd at it's best. This is some of their best music available. The only problem is the tacky shots of the band replaying some of the music in the studio in front of a blue screen. These shots are  totally out of place with the pompeii footage. The music however, redeems  this minor flaw. Particularly impressive is when David Gilmour sits down in  the dirt and messes with a metal bar and a delay peddle and when Roger  Waters is beating the hell out of the gong.
65, I didn't grow up around snow and ice, but now I live in a city that actually gets winter. I used to hate having to slip an dside down the sidewalks and would fall at least once each winter. Then, I bought Yaktrax. I've had mine for two years and they've held up to almost daily winter all winter. They really do grip the ground even with slick ice and work great in snow as well. I've also recommended them to firends who worry about elderly parents or have to commute on foot- they fit over my tennis shoes, but also work with my boots (which have a slight heel). If mine ever wear out, I'll definitely be back for more.
66, boy did i need this, with all the jewelry i have been buying..i had a good size jewelry chest, but it is overflowing and i thought this would do the job..at least i can keep my jewelry organized and see what i have..in the chest i have i opened a box and forgot i even had that pair of earrings, lol..and it will be easier to get ready and out the door..just pick this one and this one and done..also this piece is very pretty and dainty and not to big..so it fit very nicely in my bedroom..i like the painted flowers on the armoire..and that both doors open on the side..i should have plenty of room for everything!!  very nice piece, happy with purchase.
67, I love using pure tea tree oil.  Be warned, too much on your bare skin and it will BURN.  I like to add a tiny drop to a cotton pad moistened with witch hazel after my shower but before applying moisturizer to my face.  I usually wipe down my oily t-zone and maybe my whole face at least once per week.  This provides a nice cooling effect and the smell does not linger, (some mind the scent--I don't.)  Since using the oil in this manner, I have not had breakouts and my skin feels clean and smooth.  You can also add a few drops to your witch hazel and create a nice toner.  I wouldn't go over 5-20% pure tea tree oil.
68, I am not a huge fan of this band; however, i enjoy many of their singles. My dad had this in his collection unopened; he gave it to me to watch. The first time I did I knew none of the songs except for &quot;Sunday, Bloody Sunday&quot; and &quot;I Will Follow&quot; Thus I did not think much of it. Maybe a year later I decided to watch it again; I `am happy I did. This concert is in support of the &quot;BOY&quot; album is superb. U2 is note for note live. The visuals are excellent and the cameras stay on a bandmember for more than a second. Bono and company are full of energy! Even you don't like the songs the recordings and feeling is here. This video offers riveting versions of classic U2 songs. Standout versions: &quot;Surrender&quot;, &quot;Sunday, Bloody Sunday"," Eleven O' Clock Tick Tock&quot;, and &quot;I Will Follow&quot;
69, It's Dickies...you get what you pay for and that's good rugged quality fabric. It's made for a working man, from painting your shed to getting on the ground and changing your oil...they fit as expected...the Demi is thick and fits good. The pockets were a little high on the back for my taste and that's the only reason why I didn't  give it a 5 star rating, but nonetheless I like them a lot worth ever penny I spent....and my wife says and I quote &#34;they look good of your butt honey&#34;  Ha!
70, This may be the only perfect album I ever purchased. I recall waiting (along with every other music fan) for months for this work, thinking that it would be released in the next day or so. Some newspapers and magazines took out an advertisement with a semi-nude Azizi Johari saying &quot;Its almost ready&quot;. It was well worth the wait.Stevie Wonder characterized his albums with a huge range of themes and emotions, from joy to sadness, hope to dispair. S.I.T.K.O.L. was no different, from &quot;Isn't She Lovely&quot; to &quot;Knocks Me Off My Feet&quot;, from &quot;Have a Talk With God&quot; to &quot;Village Ghetto Land&quot;. They are all great. Paul Simon was right when he appeared to pick up a Grammy when he thanked Stevie for not producing a new album that preceeding year.&quot;Until 8 times 8 times 8 times 8 is four.&quot; What a wonderful testament to love. It may also be that long until a talent like Stevie Wonder comes along again and makes a classic like this again.
71, I love British comedy. My only fault is that they seem too anxious to pull the trigger and move on. Knowing that only one season remains is tough. This show really has legs, and now it will be a Fox TV comedy. &#34;Us & Them&#34; if what I have read is correct. But can anybody give Nessa the edge that Ruth does? Doubtful.This show has plenty of laugh-out-loud moments. It really does have a magic to it. Do yourself a favor and dial it up.
72, I remember seeing this advertised for like 20 minutes before disappearing forever.  I assumed, going in, that it was gonna be a complete trainwreck.I was greeted with a surprisingly watchable movie.  Somewhat ordinary story - general-guy has an army doing stuff, hero has been captured.  Hero escapes - general-guy gets captured.  Hero guy goes to save general guy.  You've seen &#34;this movie&#34; before.The action was entertaining though.  I make no claim to knowing historical accuracy one way or another, but my uninformed self found the fighting scenes plenty authentic and fun to watch.  Cast of characters was rather forgettable save the hero, and the love interest...who surprisingly doesn't make it into the movie until the final few minutes.It was way better than Immortals.  Then again, so are things I've cleaned off of the bottom of my shoe.
73, I have been using Olay Regenerist daily regenerating serum for a year and a half now (along with the Regenerist moisturizer and night cream) and I think it has slowed down the aging of my 56-year-old skin. There have been times when I've skipped the Regenerist skin care routine for a few weeks, and my skin looks duller and the fine lines on my upper lip look worse. The price is high, but you don't use much, so the cost per application is reasonable. The Regenerist products last a long time. I'm still on my first 3.4 ounce bottle of the serum. After washing my face, I use toner, then apply the Regenerist serum. By the time I've brushed my teeth, the serum has dried, and I apply either Regenerist moisturizer or Regenerist night cream. Another good thing about these products is the scent. The moisturizer and serum are unscented, and the night cream has a really lovely, mild scent.
74, I've seen Bessmertmova's Giselle on this video and on stage, simply disapointing. Since she was Bolshoi's former director Grigorovich's wife, it's easy to understand why she was the Bolshoi's ultimate Giselle and Odette, there were so many dancer's much better than this one,(Maximova, Kolpakova,Osipenko). Besmertnova has no technique, and artistically she's always herself,sad and melancholic,(and don't miss her unproportioned,huge hands!makes her port-de-bras always out of line, wrist-cracked). My favorite one? Alessandra Ferri,she's superb!
75, I love this wallet!  It has a lot of compartments, but somehow it is fairly lightweight.  The red color and design are just gorgeous.  I guess these went on sale just at the right time for me.  It's been a few months now, and the quality is excellent.One little weird comment which some people might find helpful:  the coin purse section is large enough to hold lip moisturizer!  This means if I switch the wallet to another purse, I don't forget the lip moisturizer.
76, I saw mixed reviews and bought anyway.  I should have just both two of them right off the bat.  Bought the one, put it on, and it looks fine.  If I run into problems with the springs, I think there are lots of things I can do to bind it to the step.  Fits my RV step just fine.  Now I will order the second one.  If the springs hold up, that will be great because it is good to be able to take it off easily to wash the rug.
77, Robinson's Mars Trilogy begins as admirably written hard science fiction, based for the most part on physics and geology.  As the story progresses, the plot is based more and more upon Robinson's previous suppositions than on fact - in short, he begins to extrapolate.  By the last page of the last book, we're asked to believe that human beings can postpone death almost indefinitely, have solved the problem of war, and are ready to colonize space, all in about three hundred years.  My willing suspension of disbelief wore out about two-thirds of the way through the last book.
78, Little Britain can be insanely funny though a few of the recurring characters get revisited a tad too often for me.  I tend to watch series online or by DVD so I get them in clumps which is a great way to watch serial shows but can make skit shows less funny over a marathon.  When you first watch you may find the narrator's voice to be familiar, Tom Baker does voice over work here in the US and he was one of the The Doctors.  The leads/writers are brilliant and if you watch the DVD then view the extras, Lucas in particular is an interesting person.  Walliams swam the Channel for charity.
79, Very small cars only. SUV or truck or large car tires do not fit well between the ridges and deform the product. I fastened the mat down with 4 tapcon concrete screws, each 2 inches long, into my garage slab. The leading edge of the mat tore off the screws and folded up. The adhesive strip behind the mat was also useless. I would have had better result with a 2 x 4 piece of fir or pine and concrete screwing it to the garage slab. You also have to aim the car perfectly when you park it because the mat is only as wide as the tire. I can't return it because it's damaged from use due to faulty design. Wasted my money.
80, I wasn't sure what parsley scented liquid hand soap would be like, but I really like Mrs. Meyer's products so I thought it'd give it a try. It's more like a floraly soapy smell with a hint of parsley that gives it a nice freshness. It's different and really nice. I kind of smile when I go to wash my hands with it, and always give them a little sniff afterwards because I like the smell so much. Some scents have been ruined a bit for me because so many products have them (lavender, I'm looking at you) and sometimes have them in a really unnatural smelling way, so I'm glad Mrs. Meyers has come up with some different scents that are actually great.
81, I watched this because I was in the mood for an alien movie. This is 95% about a man and a woman who gradually fall in love, amid a journey from Central America to the US border, made difficult because of travel restrictions due to an alien invasion.  I'm making it sound better than it is.  For one thing, a lot of Spanish is spoken, with very little translation. For another, this felt more like a three-hour movie, with the man and woman gazing at each other, alternating with looking out for the monsters, who conveniently only appear in the dark. There's about five minutes of monster activity, not counting the ending.  There's even a &#34;War of the Worlds&#34; (the one with Tom Cruise) ripoff scene with monster tentacles investigating a building while the woman tries to be quiet. Things happen with no explanation or purpose for the story.  What a waste of time and what a misleading title.
82, Ive used this app for the past few months to track my calorie intake on the Kindle Fire. My doctor told me I was underweight and wanted me to gain a healthy weight. I decided to document my daily food consumption and was shocked that there were days I didnt even get to 1000 calories. I love that you can log in online and offline, when internet access isn't possible, when using the app. Interface is simple, there are a variety of foods to choose from, even generic brands, and it has an easy receipe creator.
83, I bought this along with the DHS Zinc shampoo by advice of my dermatologist.  I have psoriasis and extremely sensitive skin. I can use both with no problems. This product is perfect for the "other day" shampooing. (I like to switch my shampoo and conditioning every other day) This shampoo does the job, cleanses without drying or irritation and that's all I need. I love that it doesn't have any perfumes added. I really hate all those shampoos and conditioners that are so ridiculously overly scented that give me a headache directly out of the shower. Well anyway that enough of my ranting. I just wanted to add a positive post for those of you that are thinking about it but can't make up your mind.  As I said its good for people with sensitivities or that are easily irritated. If you are looking for something high performance shampoo then this may not be the one for you.
84, The tubs works great for my 6 month son, but I could not make it work when he was a newborn... He was just too small for the tub.And yes... its almost as big as a regular sized bath tub, but that's one of the things I like about it... more fun for my son.Taking off a star because of the plug... it doesn't stay open on its own... it keeps closing, which is annoying when you are trying to drain the water while your little one is in it.
85, I loved this book at the start. The story was so engaging and ominous. The baby being run over at the start and the evil, evil, evil looking bird following Josh everywhere had me hooked. The characterization was ace too and I felt for Josh a great deal in many of his dire circumstances.But then the plot just got bogged down in hokey black magic mumbo jumbo. It lost control and just went crazy. Perhaps I didn't read it right or had other expectation but I think that it all could have been told in a better and less stupidly from that point on. Too bad considering such a strong opening.
86, I swear, I've tried so many different types of moisturizers that contain SPF in them but each one seems to leave my skin feeling oily or like I'm at the beach putting sun screen on my face. NOT cute! What I love about this product is that it contains sun screen but doesn't FEEL like you're wearing it. It literally just melts into your skin (well mine at least! Don't forget, everyone's skin is different). I use a bunch of Olay products & I have nothing but nice things to say. I love Olay!
87, mobil has the best researchers in the world designing their gas,oil and filters.....more than 50% of the NASCAR racing cars use mobil 1.....if you have the time and research oil and filters you will see that mobil will always be on the top...a few may be as good....but none are better....wait for sales....but always buy the best for your car....anything cheap will always cost you more in the end.....cheap gas has no additives and leaves your engine dirty....mobil gas has detergents that keep your engine clean....its in the tier 1 group which is the best available....for gas,oil and filters stay with mobil and your car will thank you for it......joey
88, Fresh out of jail the infamous Tupac Shakur recorded his latest and first double album &quot;All Eyes On Me&quot;.  Filled with anger, pain, sadness and relief this two disc cd is pure gold to its listener.  2pac was not just another gangster rapper, his music still lives on years after his passing for a reason.  Nobody spoke pain and struggle better then this man, and it breathes through his music.  Whether you live in the suburbs or on the streets there's at least one song that will speak to you.  Lets not forget pac can make you get up and dance aswell.  I wont speak on the track listing because almost every song on this album is solid.  Don't take my word for it however, buy any Tupac release or read &quot;The rose that grew from concrete&quot; and enter the mind of a soldier.  RIP TUPAC SHAKUR
89, I use them on my street bikes, my cars and even the yard tractor if they are going to be sitting for any amount of time. They either work, or I am just extremely lucky with batteries because I get 4-6+ years out of my batteries and have had no issues with either the batteries or the chargers.If I leave for more than 2 weeks the battery in my Audi drains down because of the constant vampiric drain from the electronics. With this, it's a 2 min job to hook up and I never have any issues. I own 4 of them and I recommend them to anybody who's not using LiPo batteries.
90, This cover was just as it was described polar white 20 to 30 pound tank fit and easy access to the valves. My only complaint is the way it fits together as both halves are identical and I understand that from a manufactures standpoint and that is a plus for the engineers who put it togetheer on the drawinging board. I just thought that one piece would fit insde the other so as to have a front and back,  but who knows, this will work out just as well. I like the fact that it was na easy assembly with CLEAR instructions to help me from making a mistake in putting it together. This cover goes great with my RV and helps it to look great.Yes i would buy this again and recomend it to anyone who would need one. Thanks
91, I purchased this to try to remove the adhesive left over from the Lamin-x on my headlights.  Luckily i tried this on a corner of the headlight before i doused the entire thing.  Within a few seconds, it had turned the clear lens a cloudy white.  I ended up having to use a restoration kit and sanding away the white part.On the other hand, I used it to clean an area before I applied some double sided tape and it worked very well!  Just before you use it, test it on a small piece first.
92, I have just ordered 2 of these SC 1200a chargers ,but have been useing two identical SC 1200a chargers for the last four years. The chargers have worked well at maintaining charge on two OPTIMA yellow top batterys and also 2 trolling motor,deep cycle batterys . The chargers are in constant use and have done a great job of keeping communications gear powered in service daily and through power outages the batterys did as expected.I have ordered 2 more as 'spares',but have had no indication of problems (except for ocasional dust removal with caned air) they are trouble free. I have also used them to charge weak auto batterys from time to time and always got the expected results.Before useing these SC 1200a chargers ,I was concerned about the ability of high frequency chargers vs chargers with heavy transformers. The SC 1200a's have proved to be FASTER at rechargeing my batterys and have outlasted the majority of other chargers I have used, they are also much lower cost than many I have used before.
93, By 1977 The Commodores became known for songs like&quot;Easy&quot; and &quot;Zoom&quot;,both mushy ballads to be found here.On theother end &quot;Squeeze Th Fruit&quot; and &quot;Funky Situation&quot; lean too farinto funk-by-numbers stylings and don't stand out as much morethen album filler.This is where The Commodores funk tunesbegan to become songless album tracks,bar the bands stunningtheme song &quot;Brick House&quot;,clearly the best thing on the record.So I baught this expecting a consistant album on a par with&quot;Brick House&quot; and ended up with an uneven collection,but that was a vinyl LP with a poster.So why would you want the CD?Because it's available I suppose.
94, The product name "Stress Relief Body Wash" says it all. This wonderful product, put out by Aveeno, does the job. Made with wonderful ingredients, like lavender, chamomile and ylang-ylang, you feel the stress of the day melt off of your body. Its special soap free formula gets the job done, in addition to the wonderful addition of oatmeal, as a base. It smells heavenly, without being tacky or overly perfumed. Please use this if you need a lift, or, simply a release from day-to-day pressure. This is good as a companion item to any shower in America......
95, I've loved every one of Martin's preceding books in this series.  Unfortunately, book five falls short of the excellence we've come to expect from the author.  Reading this book has been like talking to my mother-in-law on the phone.  That is to say, Martin goes on and on, in excruciating detail, about people and situations that have no apparent bearing on the real story.  This book is a long, tedious read.  I have yet to finish it, and I started it almost two months ago.  For an avid reader, that should speak volumes!I hope that he brings the story back around in book six and that it's not another disappointment.
96, Thirty years after its release, this LP never ceases to move or amaze me; I was astonished upon its release and remain so.  The production was radical for its day, and continues to set standards. Compare this gem to  the machines-mating thud and vitrolic adolescence of modern-day Eminems and  Snoop Doggs and you're left wondering if all of Marvin's sad prophecies did  not, indeed, come true. The seamless fusion here of cinematic strains  (girls in the background at one point quote the words and music from an  esoteric French film, 'Live for Life'), funk, pop, rock and free-form jazz  remains uuncontested. No one had a sweeter voice than Marvin, and it never  seemed in better form than on this outing (which Motown execs were  reluctant to even release!). I can't quibble with any cut on this  album-long suite of songs.  It's just darned perfect.
97, I almost bought a different scent, but when i noticed this one included 2 items at the same price that the other was listed just for one bottle i chose this one instead. I hadn't smelled the fragrance prior to purchasing online, but was happy with it. I started using one of those foaming soap pumps to save money. I just used a couple squirts of this soap mixed with some water and i'm happy it will last much longer that a normal bottle of hand soap. I've always been happy with this brand, so i didn't hesitate to buy online and would definitely buy again.
98, I am in LOVE with these boots! They fit great and are oh-so comfortable. I bought these to wear because they are so versatile and go with absolutely everything. I have worn them with shorts, jeans and they look great with dresses! Now that I own a pair of Ariat boots, I am hooked!!! The only odd thing about the boots is the way they size them. I normally wear a 9.5, but I had to get these in a 9.5 wide because the fit is so narrow.
99, It's a neat idea...the problem is...the replacement bags cost too much and don't justify the convenience.  Honestly, my husband and I use the plastic bags that the daily newspaper comes in.  They are slim and hold about 7-10 diapers.  At the end of the day, we toss them out into the garage...end of story.  If you really need this kind of doodad, there is another type out there where you can use your own plastic bag...that's much better than this deal.

101, Have enjoyed this for about two weeks now. Makes it so easy to keep track of everything from food,exercise & yard work! Its very easy to find homemade versions of foods and prepackaged versions. Some of the exercises I do with my trainer aren't in the list but I'm able to put in 90% of them. My hubby & I are friends on the app so its cool that we get to keep track of each others progress throughout the day. Looking forward to much success with this app!
102, After the brilliant,yet bewildered &quot;Journey Through The Secret Life Of Plants&quot;,Stevie rushed out(by his standards) with Hotter Than July,the true follow-up to Songs In The Key Of Life.The fact that it isn't up to the standards of the Talking Book or Innervisions is already a constant,but it brings a closure to a winning streak of albums that began with 1972's Music Of My Mind(or 71's Where I'm Coming From according to true Stevie fans).Every cut is a stand-out especially Master Blaster,All I Do,I Ain't Gonna Stand For It(a country tinged tune worthy of a Garth Brooks cover),and the much interpretated classic Lately.The final cut,the MLK-tribute Happy Birthday brings the album to a glorious open-ended finish as well as beautifully closes the book on this Wonder-ful chapter of his career.
103, I bought Valeo Ultimate blades for my 1999 Toyota Camry. Installation was easy, even though some sort of an explanation on the box on how to remove the old blade would have been appreciated.The blades remove water very well in city driving and at freeway speeds. I do not experience any squeaking, skipping or wind noise problems.The downside, of course, is the price. When the time comes to replace these, most likely, I will go back to regular Toyota wiper inserts since I kept the original wipers. In my opinion, the inserts, when changed regularly, perform just as well.
104, I LOVE Soft Style shoes and rarely have a problem with sizing. I ordered my regular size, which is a 7.5 but found it tight in the toe box. This style is a great shoe! It is not a complete flat but has a very small heel, just what I was looking for especially since I am petite. Often flats do not give me enough height and this shoe was perfect in giving me just a little more height than a flat shoe. It is not a shoe I would consider as a pump but as a nice casual flat with a small heel :) I think going up a size would be too big. Wish it fit.
105, There is no way that these were originally $70 headphones.  Yes, I liked them for a while and worked great with the iPhone. Sound was pretty good and great for call.  Then they suddenly just stopped working on the one ear, wire looked connected fine, I was able to wiggle it to get some sounds for a little while, but overall it just died.  Not pleased that I now have to buy some new ones and disappointed that these just did not last for even a year.
106, Let me start off with this : Tupac is a storyteller. If you want a party album,do not get this.Everyone already probably knew that,though. The second cd is better than the first one. Best song on the first cd : &quot;Only God Can Judge Me.&quot; Best song on the second cd : &quot;Shorty Wanna Be A Thug.&quot; Lets see,all in all, a whole lot of good songs, but not nearly enough to make it &quot;the best rap album ever&quot; as some of the reviews say.Even though its not the best rap album ever,it is still worthy of the money that it costs. Buy this. You won't be dissapointed.
107, It was probably right there in the manual all along...this thing is about the equivalent of a bluetooth earpiece except that it stops the music...if you have a friend that has a stereo that imports the contact list, dials from the screen, etc. They do not have a NX409 or NZ409...the screen doesn't even know the phone is there until a call comes through. Don't even think about the possibility of putting your phone away and seeing the name come up on the screen.Not really sure that $78 + installation + where do I put the wired microphone = worth not having to wear an earpiece.Bluetooth music? I guess that could be useful if Pandora worked better on my phone, but it is much easier just to stick your mp3s on a usb stick or ipod.I'm about ready to put it on Craigslist and take my loss now. :(
108, I've been through a lot of headsets. Each one has issues with how well they work or how well they fit. I have a BlueAnt Z9 which fits pretty well but picks up noises like running water or shuffling paper and delivers them at ear-splitting levels to my caller. The Jawbone 2 is beautiful but doesn't fit because the required jaw contact is hard to maintain and you don't know until the caller says (again) that he can't hear you.I tried the Sennheiser because I love their other products. I wasn't expecting much but it's both light and comfortable. It's quite large but it's very light and I very quickly forget it's there. It works really well, with a pleasant chime to tell you it's connected and when a call arrives. No complaints from callers and the sound is good. Noise rejection is pretty good, too.This is now my main headset.By the way, I use it with an iPhone.
109, I you love bathing in oil like I do, you'll love this one. This one leaves you with a very luxurious, silky feel. I massage it onto my scalp, my hair... unlike Castor Oil, coconut oil, olive oil or almond oil or any other one I've used, this one's lighter. You can easily remove it with shampoo.I massage it all throughout my face (never clogged pores), my body (unlike coconut oil, I hope this one doesn't grow hair. Yes, if you like your hair on your scalp or anywhere else to thicken or to grow, use coconut oil)This acts as a wonderful conditioner for the hair. It's natural, it's organic, it's inexpensive, I love this oil.
110, Really, I should have added a few more "O"s to LOOOOVE - that's how much I love this product. It's comfortable and easy to get on and off - and unless you have exceptionally big (or small) ears this will fit you. If you're worried about this looking "unprofessional" - it doesn't! (And I'm honestly surprised by that!) It's really discrete and very pretty. I've been wearing mine for a few days now and hasn't fallen off once. My one gripe (and I gave it 5 stars despite this) is that the plastic case it came in was cracked on both sides. I threw the case away and kept the earring but it probably wouldn't be such a bad thing if these were shipped in boxes rather than the padded envelope I received mine in.
111, This SIM is an excellent product to have with you and your unlocked Quad band GSM phone when you travel abroad.The coverage is extensive ( 170+ countries ), no fees, no surcharges, no minimum charges, no taxes, no line maintenance fees.Just keep it and use it when you need to. Great as a back-up to another card or for emergency use.The rates are high for most countries so use should be for emergencies or short calls only. If you want to talk a lot use a phone card and a pay phone or buy a local SIM. But for emergency or occasional use you cannot beat it. It is also a good value if you are traveling to the UK as all incoming calls there are free on your cell with this SIM ( UK only ).I would not leave the country without it.
112, Robinson's "Red Mars" follows the stories of 100 men and women as they train for, travel to, and inhabit Mars. Each chapter in the novel is told from the distinct point of view of one of several major characters.  Oddly, Robinson's technique fails to reveal anything really interesting about any of these people.  When American space hero, John Boone, is murdered in the first chapter, I expected to eventually find out why.  Is that alot to hope for?  Other events ensue, Mars changes, more major characters die... to me, at least, these characters never seemed all that alive in the first place...While "Red Mars" is certainly vast in scope and largely interesting from a scientific standpoint, the overall story suffers from underdeveloped characters, an overemphasis on Martian landscape, and no cohesive plot.  And maybe that's Robinson's plan - the major character in the novel is Mars itself, not the folks who live there...
113, I have always heard good things about Royal Purple and it was not until now that I can attest to the fact that their products are indeed top of the line.  I used the transmission fluid and gear lube for my Suzuki XL& and sure enough everything is working smoothly without weird noises anymore.  It feels like the transmission shift much smoother without downshifting issues during deceleration/braking.  I have not had it in long enough to see if we have better mileage but the truth is, a transmission should not really affect mileage.  I plan to use the rest of the case on my other two vehicles that I have owned longer to see if it makes a difference. Do not hesitate to purchase this product.  Amazon free shipping is always a plus.
114, I have this on the side of our Jenny Lind dressing table.  I fit two rows of stacked newborn pampers swaddlers diapers in it (with the fold facing out), and they dispense just fine.  There is plenty of room to fit everything I need to use at the changing table in the side pockets... and I use the Dex Wipe Warmer with changing light in the area of the wipe holder.  It is a little bigger than the space alloted, but I find that the rubber non-skid bumps on the bottom of the warmer hold it within the wipes space... and since it is raised above the depot's wipes space it leaves room for any extra wipes that didn't fit inside the warmer.  This was a great buy, and I don't know what I would have done without it.  Everything is at a hands reach when I am changing my daugher (6 weeks old now) and I literally can hold her with one hand and reach everything with the other because of this.
115, I remember this like it was yesterday.  My old worn out VHS copy is still hanging in there, but if Warner Bros. knows what's good for them (and when it comes to Prince, they obviously don't) they'll give this tape the artistic treatment it deserves.Classic moments.  Absolute classics.  &quot;I Could Never Take the Place of Your Man&quot; brings me to tears every time I see it.  They are in such a groove on that song that even a nuclear bomb blast couldn't touch them.  Simply breathtaking playing, wonderful compositions, and high level performances.
116, I have not given this item three stars because there is any defect in it, but because I had assumed it was a large shampoo comb. My disappointment came from the size of the package and even more disappointed once I removed this comb from the package. If you're expecting a large shower shampoo comb this is not what you're looking for. This seems to appear to be better suited for short hair or a young child's hair. Not suitable for thick curls as from the looks of it , it would not last very long. Again nothing wrong with the product itself, it's just not a large shower comb.
117, I'm not sure what to make of all of the negative reviews on this thing - it works fine for me in charging an iPod as well as my wife's iPad (I know, the Kindle enthusiast has an iPad in the family - don't tell anyone).  There realy isn't too much you can say in a review for a product like this - it either works as advertised or it does not, and in this case it does.  For this price, it certainly beats purchasing an Apple-branded charger!
118, when moonwalker first came out...and just like millions of teens like me, i had to go and buy the vhs tape which i treasured.  but i have a feeling that moonwalker won't be on dvd for the u.s. anytime in the near future.  and who can blame michael??  i'm sure in other countries, his public image is a lot better than america when we have people like nancy grace trashing him on a daily basis.  but for 1988, this tape kicked [...]!!  and you def. got your $$ worth...but i would love to see it on dvd for the rest of us.
119, The BBC creates some of the best mysteries on television and they are not at all afraid of delving into the &#34;Dark Side&#34; of their leading characters. Wallender comes to mind as a series whose lead character is fairly seriously flawed, even to the point of being uncomfortable to watch at times. Well, Touching Evil makes Wallender look like walk in the park so be advised. It is very dark with almost no lighter moments and each following episode after the first seems to get darker. I'll not give away any details but be prepared. You'll enjoy the series (make that &#34;become enthralled&#34; because &#34;enjoy&#34; just isn't the right word) like a book you can't put down. I give it four stars because it's a Really Good Show (apologies to Ed), just not very fun to watch.Hope this makes sense...
120, Red Mars is a classic story of world building in the most literal sense - it is the first volume in Robinson's tale of Martian terraforming, and the political and scientific implications of human colonization.  It is genuinely important, as it takes the possibility of human travel into space as a real thing, and not a fantastic bit of fiction. But the very realism of the story makes for a slow (albeit rewarding) read: Robinson spends significant time on the details, and his grasp of the minutae is overwhelming at times.  Nevertheless, the characters he creates - larger than life pioneers who echo the explorers of an earlier age - pull the story back when it threatens to become turgid.  Profoundly worthwhile for anyone who cares about the actual future of humanity and whether space travel will ever really happen.
121, Since English is my second language reading this book was tough, but I loved reading it. What made it tough wasn't the quality of the writing -which is impeccable- but the plethora of unnecessary characters that I don't see advancing the story. The characters that we love aren't in control of their destiny but seem mostly reactive. The miracle is that things seem to be coming together despite of that, and the revelations (and cliffhangers) in this book promise a storm of events that will bring this series to a conclusion. Overall a depressing cynical book that I think could've rivaled " A Storm of Swords" if it was combined as originally planned with " A Feast for Crows" and the(iron born+ Quentyn + Briene ...etc) were just removed
122, These work well - installed them just before a 2000 mile trip in mostly rain and they worked very well both in heavy rain and light  mist. No streaks, no chatter, and no problem with wind. My previous wiper blade would tend to lift off the windshield a bit at high speeds. I'm not sure if it's from the beam design of these blades or what, but they worked well at all speeds.They were very easy to install, I nearly needed a hammer to get my last set of blades on and off, but these snapped right on easily.
123, Tough combat vetran kills drug-pushers left and right, because they killed his girl friend. In between killing gangsters at home he slips (actually swims) into North Vietnam to help save the lives of American POWs.I had to read this big book to the end to find in what creative way he kills off all the pushers, but I could only do it by skiping and skiming over and through detailed build-up that was just too long and slow for me.I prefer, for example, Dan Brown's more concise method of crafting thillers -- due to this prefrence of mine -- I take one star away from Mr. Clancy.
124, This app was recommended by a friend and it let me set up an account on my friends laptop but when I went to sign in on my kindle fire HD. It told me that I had the wrong password and I know it was correct because I wrote it down. Also I got another error something about token dismissal. Anyways very disappointed because I couldn't even set up an account on my kindle I had to use a friend's laptop and then I thought if I downloaded it again and put in my info it would let me in, but no such luck!!!!! Very disappointed and a big waste of time. I went to the lose it app and it pretty much does the exactly same thing my fitness pal does except &quot;lose it&quot; actually works
125, I knew about John Clark from Sum of All Fears but didn't know anything about him, who he was and how he "came to be" John Clark.  I thought the book was very well written of course, but the story is good too.  John is someone you can really like.  Typically I don't care for the "killers" in the books, but John is different.  This book was just a little bit slow getting started but when it did, it was great.  It goes from one spot in the story to another just a little bit more than I like, but all in all, it was good.  I would read it again and watch a movie knowing the outcome too.
126, Scofield's playing is on point as always. To me his duo and jazz organ trio are decent but not as spectacular as the quartet performance, which is smoking. Another minus is the lack of bonus features, such as an interview with Sco or backstage footage with the other musicians on the bill. But considering the production values of jazz performances recorded in the early 90's, its likely the record company and the producers were being budget-conscious(i.e., cheap). Too bad. It would have been interesting to know what was going through Scofield's mind back then. He's very insightful, and a pretty funny guy to boot. All in all I still recommend this DVD, just don't expect much beyond the live performance.
127, I saw this watch and loved it. It looks great and feels even better. It a good match - perfect for the Boardroom and you can lift in it after work. However, the thing is a battery killer! I could rarely keep the analog part (which uses more energy) from running. It would stop, while the digital part would keep working. That kind of annoyed me. So, I sold it and got a pure digital Ironman with a metal band. It's better is all respects other than looks - it just doesn't look as good as this watch does.
128, A bit of a departure from his high tech thrillers.  While there is no shortage of high tech gadgets, they are not the focal point.  The focal point is the origin of the mysterious Mr. Clark.  Mr. Clark, who began life as John Kelly, is a highly trained and experienced Navy SEAL.  While home in the U.S., he crosses paths with a domestic drug ring.  If you've ever wondered what a highly trained commando could do to a bunch of ruthless thugs, this is your book.  I enjoyed every word of it.
129, I qualify 5 stars because it would be unfair to give a bad reputation, I purchased this product on September 27, I Bought 2 Armor extreme shine, I live in South America so I need an address where my purchases must arrived in the united States and then send to my country. My courier company said that they couldn&#8217;t transport Aerosol or contents under pressure because is a dangerous goods. I had to declare the product as abandoned, I lost my purchase. I will not be able to watch my shiny wheels, I'm sad about that, but I'm sure it's an excellent product because I have purchased other products of &#8220;Armor all&#8221; that are not dangerous goods and arrived without problems to my country where I check the good quality of their products.
130, While there is no song in the universe as beautiful and as sexy as My My My, this is a fantastic effort for the next cd.  The best song on here is Cute Sweet Love Addiction.  I love it - it is cool and upbeat and basically just fun.  The Floor was such a big hit for obvious reasons - it's tight and very funky, but the best ballad is Quiet Time To Play.  It's in that song that I think he works his vocalls the best and shows off his incredible skills.  I love Johnny and this is one of many of his albums I own.  I really recommend it because of the mix between fast music and sexy bedroom ballads.
131, I originally bought these tights to wear with a Halloween costume since I figured I could get away with shimmery legs then.  These aren't glittery or obnoxious with shimmer, they just give you gleaming, sexy legs!  Seriously, they looked better than I could have ever imagined!  I ordered the toast, which is a pretty deep tan color.  I was a little worried they would be too dark because I'm fairly pale but I go tanning.  They ended up being the perfect color, but I may need the light toast for winter.  I think you could get away with these during the day as well, so I'm ordering more colors!
132, Bought this to replace the factory cooler on my 2002 F150. Had to do some careful thinking on how I wanted to mount it but was able to make it work with the provided brackets and screws/bolts. The kit came with some fittings that were not the right size for my truck at all, searched local hardware and auto stores and had no luck finding the fittings. Decided to cut my rubber inlet/outlet hoses and use hose clamps to hold the fittings securely. Haven't had any issues with leaks.My transmission temp was getting a bit warm with the old beat up cooler installed. With this new B&M; cooler my transmission temp is about 10-20 degrees cooler than before.For reference, my 2002 F150 7700 has the 4R100 transmission.
133, A few months ago I ordered and received a different chain but after giving a good review, it broke.  It was really my inexperience because I ordered a much thinner one.  My son needed a chain for a medal he wears and when the first one broke after many years I ordered one that was just to fine for his medal.  This one seems to be much stronger and I believe it will last for a long time.  He is very pleased with it and it is of very good quality.
134, WW says, &quot;if you bite it, write it!&quot;  That is just one of the strengths of this app-wherever I am, I have a huge database of foods to help log my intake accurately.  More important than the numbers is being mindful of what I eat, appropriate portioning, and nutritional values.  I can track my progress by weight, nutritional ratios, and other measurements.  This app does far more than I use.  Think I'll invite a friend to join me!
135, These are a good product and wear well.  I wear them on my property doing a number of chores including tending our goat herd.  They are comfortable and provide plenty of pockets.  The only criticism was that I ordered a 30" inseam and received a 36" inseam.  Not a deal breaker, I just cut 5" off.  Also, the ones I received were not a light blue, they were dark blue.  Not a problem for me, but could be for someone wanting a light blue pair.
136, I have been into reggae since the 70's (when it actually &#34;broke out&#34;) and still sing &#34;ZION&#34; in meetings. Bob's music is timeless. He was the biggest of them all. Watching this performance is like 1) a tunnel of time, and 2) bringing you back to the essentials. It goes both ways. I have never seen him live, but this is as close as it gets. Played the DVD twice in a row. The back-up singers seem tired at the very beginning, but then they loosen up and start to enjoy the fun. The music is just outstanding - simple, laid-back and harmonious. The part when Bob starts to dance is for crying out loud.Enjoy this!
137, I bought this about 4 or 5 months ago from Amazon (BargainCell) for less than a dollar +plus shipping; followed the instructions - cleaned the iphone, wiped it clean with the given cloth and applied the screen. Screen goes in very nicely and no air bubbles. It has been more than four months and the screen still has no air bubbles and is protecting the screen very well.Another advantage is that this screen smudges MUCH less compared to the original iphone screen and so it doesn't look that bad. (still you need to clean the surface with moist paper or something once in a week or so).A great buy!
138, I like this mattress pad cover b/c it's much easier to put on than the Evenflo one I have.  My Evenflo one you have to tug, pull, and stetch to get it on and even then it's not on perfect, a real pain.  It does &quot;pill&quot; a little after being washed, but it doesn't concern me, you put a sheet over it anyway.  My 5 month old daughter's diaper has leaked a couple of times overnight and the mattress stayed dry, that's all I need!
139, My biggest surprise when moving to this headset was how good it sounds.  Call quality is as good as I've heard out of any headset, and this one is well above most others in its price range.  I would like the volume to go up a bit louder for noisier surroundings, but overall I think this is a great headset.  I especially like the little charging stand.  You just take the headset off, turn it off and drop it into the little magnetized cradle and voila, its charging.  No little tiny cords to push into little tiny holes like most headsets..
140, Since I prefer to travel light and still need to carry my neck ties for business meeting, I have always been on the look out for a convenient travel tie case, just functional enough to hold my ties. Then I came across this Travel Tie Case with Accessory Pocket Black Ramie from Household Essentials which can hold up to 6 neck ties. Its padded cushion lining keeps your ties wrinkle free while the elastic straps hold them in place. It comes in black color and is reasonably priced too. The product is just perfectly suited as a household item or a travel accessory.
141, Prince was recovering from the critically panned "Under the Cherry Moon" when he recorded, arguably his greatest record ever, "Sign O' The Times" and released the concert movie of the same title. I don't know what the man did with this record and the film but he hit the target everytime. From "Housequake" to "If I Was Your Girlfriend" every song performed live became an experience and made me a Prince fan in the process. This film is least talked about and the folks at Universal or WB should consider releasing this on DVD. Prince's "Sign O' The Times" is a hidden gem in Prince's illustrious career.
142, Fantastic movie! Love the set-up... Romans vs Picts. Great action adventure movie. This one's up there with "Agora" as my favorite movie of the year. Don't buy many dvds anymore, but this one's a keeper. If you liked "Dog Soldiers" or "The Descent", you'll love this one. It's Mr. Marshall's best movie yet! Don't mind the other reviews that are middling to negative. This movie is thoroughly enjoyable from start to finish. Brisk pacing, fantastic fight scenes, great acting, sexy men, one beautiful woman, one evil woman and lovely landscapes, beautifully filmed. What more can a guy want in a escapist movie? Fully satisfied here.
143, Stevie, Stevie, Stevie!! Where has all the brilliance gone? There are exactly 3, count 'em, 3 good songs on this album and they simply aren't enough to salvage what amounts to a piece of pedestrian product and half-hearted attempts at sounding comtemporary. The opener, &quot;You Will Know&quot; with it's simple message of hope and lilting fairlight melody, &quot;With Each Beat Of My Heart&quot;, his least syrupy ballad in years and the skeletal groove of &quot;Skeletons&quot; and it's indictment of liars, cheaters and cover-ups (Corporate America should really listen to this one nowadays) are the only worthwhile tracks here and it breaks my heart to listen to the rest of the garbage that makes up the remainder of this release. Filler is one thing, but this is ridiculous.
144, I have used this solvent a number of times to remove adhesive and badging from my cars.  For that it works wonderfully.  When used modestly it does not effect automotive surfaces or glass.  Since this stuff is so potent, I would recommend using the the spray straw in the nozzle so that you can more carefully target where you spray this stuff.  You want to be very careful where you put it.  It also evaporates rapidly so you need to work quickly when you use it.Just to reinforce a few precautions:- Do not get this on plastic (it will discolor it) or any soft/organic materials.- Do not use around high eat, as it is extremely flammable- Limit all bodily exposureOverall this is a wonderful product, just be very careful how you use it.
145, I love the interaction between the characters, especially Joy and Elka. Victoria's vanity and Melanie's &#34;adorable&#34; are spot on! Having all the guest stars from other sitcoms the ladies have played in is truly interesting. Carol Burnett, Mary Tyler Moore, Bonnie Franklin, Georgia Engel, Tim Conway, Valarie Harper....and the list goes on. The comedy is well-timed, funny, and the cast knows how to maximize the effect. Overall a truly funny, enjoyable, heart-warming series with the best cast out there!
146, I picked up one of these on sale recently, and was pretty impressed with the product.  I've been able to squeeze about three full charges for my iPhone 4S out of the device. The included LED/laser combination is probably pretty nifty if you already carry those around, although I haven't found a need for them in my experience. There's a single multifunction button that is used to both control charging as well as the included LED/laser, and it took me a little while to get used to the controls. The battery itself charges through a standard microUSB cable, and the rated 4-5 hour charge time is accurate in my experience. For the price and form factor, the IMP52D provides a solid, respectable product.
147, Last week I used Clairol foam to dye my hair back to its natural medium golden brown from a blue streak... and it came out a dead dark auburn (not to mention the mess on my sink that's still there). It looked AWFUL. I'd heard of Sun-In before and knew the bottle said not to use on colored hair. But a lot of people had tried it and said it was fine, so I used it on a hidden section first.The spray is easy to use and the smell is very nice. A hairdryer later and that section was slightly lighter. If figured if it wasn't light enough I could do it again later so I did my whole head. It looks GREAT. It took out the deadening greyish red that looks so unnatural with my skin and replaced it with my natural gold.So yes, this product works great on at least my colored hair. But always test it first!
148, Stargate died with this show. And it wasn't that bad a series , it was just different and if they'd have had atlantis still on when this was airing. People would have been much more accepting of this show as a experiment.  That wasn't the case though and this season was much better than the first one in many ways. The is only a vague ending though. For this season they didn't bother with a blu ray release which is unfortunate. Still the show is engaging and the characters were interesting. And this season had alot more action than the first. But it was hopeless as scy fy was more intent on weekend movies than maintaining a tv series like this one.  There's extras on this and that's a good thing but this show never had a chance and that's a shame.
149, I love everything about it. I love the  set up, and the choices offered for input , it has a pencil choice, an eraser, a digital choice and the background is really cool done in a very soft green with bamboo shoots and leaves. I know some people don't care about that kind of stuff but I love ascetics along with really good and varied options on how I want to do my puzzles.  I have been a Sudokunut, since they became popular about 12 years ago. Have played many different of the various Sudoku apps on my phone, and pc, but this is so so so my favorite.
150, We absolutely love the EuroBath!  We use it in conjunction with the Safer Bather bath pillow and our 6 month old just loves bath time!  The tub is incredibly well constructed, with a convenient drain at the bottom.  Whether your new baby is lounging on the one side, or your older baby is sitting on the other side, it is a safe, secure and comfortable way to bathe your child.Do not be frightened away from this fantastic tub because of its size.  It is longer than many tubs, but you can use it for a very long time and it stores conveniently right inside your bathroom tub or closet.I HIGHLY recommend this product!
151, For Clancy lovers, the names Clark and Ryan are not new.  What is new, though, is this book, which strays from Ryan completely, and gives readers the background of Clancy's most mysterious character.  This book, in my opinion, is nothing like any of the other Clancy tales to date.  It was published right in between some of Clancy's most popular books, yet has nothing to do with any of them.  It takes place in the Washington/Baltimore area and Vietnam and is a great thriller.  There is no technical mumbo-jumbo that is typically found in Clancy's works.  It's all action of the best kind.  If you have never before read one of Tom Clancy's books, I highly recommend this one as your first.  It's a great book that will be enjoyed by all and read over again.. I've already read it twice!! Enjoy!
152, I actually never used it but here is why.  When I finally got the package it was folded in half with tire marks all over it.  Like the mail man folded it, laid in on the street, backed up right on top of it, and proceeded to power brake and burn out on top of it.  needless to say the screen had unfixable creases and was barely still in the wrapper.it might be a good protector and it really probably had absolutely nothing to do with the seller but I was pretty steamed.
153, These sneakers are supposed to be for walking but there isn't enough cushion for me to walk very far in them.  I bought them to wear to work on days when I don't want to wear dress shoes.  Maybe it's me but I am finding it hard to buy shoes, most of the time they are either too small or fall off my feet.  These sneakers are comfortable enough to wear to work but my feet still slip in them, however since they are sneakers I don't walk out of them.  I have custom orthotics for my shoes due to foot & knee issues so buying shoes can be a challenge.  I will keep these sneakers and wear them since they fit the bill for me and they are comfortable but I can't give them a glowing review.
154, This is a very interesting concept.  It is general psychic-type information given via electronic technology to a man who shares it to stop it or change the outcome.  While the information comes through very similar as it does to a psychic, it can also be very specific.  Still, the problems with interpretation become evident.  It involves human flaws, the growing awareness of possible multiple interpretations, and a chance to make a difference.  How does this affect ego, awareness of perception, government control, and more.  I enjoyed all of these shows.
155, I recently used the IMP52D iTorch at a 4 day convention and it was a huge life saver! It's very small form factor and extra large capacity (5200mAh) allowed me to fit it in my pocket along with my phone while charging, and kept me fully charged throughout the whole day. It charged my phone just as fast as my home charger, and was able to fully charge my Galaxy SIII twice, and still had enough for another half charge. This device is very well made, and does not feel like it will break. The plastic texture seems to be a scratch resistant plastic with matte finish. A bonus feature to this extra battery is the inclusion of a laser pointer and LED flashlight, both work exactly as expected. The LED is bright enough to help you in dark conditions, and is visible in normal light. The included USB cable with interchangeable ends is well made and fits snugly into the unit as well as my device.
156, I am amazed by Martins' abililty to develope characters that you route for and some of the most dispicable characters ever created in literature. The problem is the use of these characters. The saga continues and more story lines are added to the already over inundated story. Nothing is concluded. I did not feel any closer to resolution after this book than when I began. As I have from the beginning, I feel almost beaten up at points. In conclusion, with the extraordinary length of this novel, I am very disappointed with the result. Unfortunately, It is impossible for me to give up on a series one I start. If you don't have this issue, I don't recommend this book.
157, I have used it to test different Strategies. I thought it would be a completely random process for the program to generate cards, but I was wrong. At low wager level (say less than $10), it is close to random with the house having slightly higher winning percentage. As soon as you go up the amount of bet above $10, you will see that you are always at a huge disadvantage! The intent is very obvious: to bankrupt you quickly so you may buy chips from them. Instead of playing blackjack, you are blackmailed! Screw it, I will never spend a penny on this wicked program.The only good thing is to train you the basic strategy with the smallest bet, but for that purpose, there are plenty of good apps doing much better training job.The U I is good.
158, Works perfectly on a 1997 Honda Prelude. Replaced the rotor as the same time as the distributor cap and wires and plugs. Might as well since you are in there and it is so cheap.The trick to getting it off is that the one screw that holds it in, is only accessible when the engine cylinders are in a specific location. I found it easiest to disconnect all the spark plugs so it wouldn't actually start then crank the car momentarily. After you crank go and check if the screw is there. If not, crank again, check again. Took me about 8 tries, but it is really random. The precise way of doing it is to turn it by hand or to put in gear and roll it slowly, but I found it much easier to just crank and try.
159, This is the second junior I have owned.  My first was used on my motorcycles, worked great, and was eventually included in the sale of a motorcycle.  I have never used the clip adapters but the ring terminal adapter is great.  You attach it to the battery terminals and simply connect the junior at the quick disconnect.I have also used the junior to keep a weak car battery going until I could get a replacement installed.  The car was parked just outside my garage in the winter.  So the junior is plugged inside and the cord ran under the garage door and out to the car.  This second one keeps my summer car happy while it is hibernating during winter.  I expect it to work just as well as the first junior.
160, A warning should be made about this video: this documentary is for those who understand the historical value of the footage. Sure, there are a lot of scenes of the Beatles in hotels, limousines, trains, etc. But isn't it  wonderful that a movie camera was there to capture it all? And there is  even a candid scene of George creating some weird noises in his acoustic  guitar, anticipating the Indian-influenced, experimental music he would  make in the late 60's. This video is NOT for the casual Beatles fan who  wants to show his daughter that they were better than the Backstreet Boys.  But it is certainly the most generous collection of Beatles footage ever  released on home video! And the television appearances are the icing on the  cake!
161, This terry cloth cover has been a lifesaver. It covers the cold vynil of my changing pad. It cover the big fat rips in my vynil changing pads too, so that you would never know that its ripped. It has caught numerous undiapered poops and pees and went right into the wash without having to wipe a thing up. That was my favorite quality of it.I have two of these so that when one is in the wash the other is on the changing pad. The only beef that I have with it is that after the first wash, one of the Terry covers ripped at the seam. Thats ok though, it was fixed quickly with a few stitches. No matter what it was a GREAT BUY.
162, Bought 3 one of these.  The watch is easy to see, has 3 alarms, and has nice colors.But, the bands are not replaceable (they stretch off the watch) and the lighter colored ones show dirt, and some of the dirt can't be cleaned off.  The band on 1st watch gave out after one year.  The 2nd watch didn't survive beginning open water diving (20 minutes at a maximum of 35'). The band on the 3rd watch lasted only two months.
163, Went onto a 1995 Honda Civic.  My wife needs to get used to the shape of this style  of wiper.  We have had one day of rain and she said they worked. The true test of a wiper is in the long run and I can't address this since I have only had the wiper for a few days. Many years ago I bought an expensive Bosch wiper and the cheapest Trico I could find for my Honda Accord. I put them on on the same day. The cheap Trico outperformed and outlasted the Bosch. I am hoping to have better luck this go.
164, Bought this to connect my speakers to my TV.  Its ok, I guess for $4.50 now you cannot expect much, but I dont expect it to last.  The cord is really thin.  I have to make sure I use minimum bending radiuses or else I feel like I will snap it in half.I also seem to get some 60hz hum if I leave any of the extra cord laying around behind my TV. and the associated power cords.First cord got sucked up into the vacuum and is longer usable.  Ordered another and the metal connector just broke off.  Looking for a different item this time.
165, I got this,and set it up easily. At FIRST,it seemed great- I hate holding the cell phone,and I could use my old cordless phones,and answer them easily. SOund could be a bit staticky,but I could live with that...HOWEVER.... AFter 2-3 months of use, it is SO glitchy. It works randomly,usually not working at all,even though the blue lights show it is supposed to be paired.  ***At first,I wrote this review about how I disliked this- but I figured out that if I unplug it, and plug it back in after 30 seconds,it reboots and works properly again. AFter having it for a year+, I have had to do this about every month or so. Once I got that down, no problem-it's great! so, if you don't mind doing this,it's a good option.
166, Love these, bought them in this color and black. Only problem is that I'm fair-skinned and this light toast color is like Malibu tan, which might work in the summer. They hide any spider veins or light/small discolorations well. The shimmer is nice, kind of understated. See my review about the ultra shimmery footed tight in black for issues regarding feet slipping in shoes after these are put on, because it's important to know.I will order these in the lighter skin tone, as they might be a better match for me to wear year round.
167, We decided to go with this bath tub after reading lots of reviews about it...they were all positive!When we received it via courier, we were happy with the quality although found it a bit big.Our daughter is 5 weeks old and we've used it about 6 times or so.  Unfortunately we have to use it in the bath tub since it's so big which makes it difficult for us having to bend over all the time to wash her.  We don't have that much kitchen counter space so it won't work in that manner.All in all, our daughter enjoys it and seems quite secure in it.  She's not slipping around and she is well supported.PROS:-plastic seems durable, not flimsy-no foam/anti slip material in tub = less mildew, bacteria growth-has drain in tub-infant is well supportedCONS:-a little pricey-bigCompared to all the other tubs we saw, this one is a lot better in quality and function.  I would definitely recommend this to my friends!
168, Before I got photobucket, I was worried about losing my phone, b/c it has all my priceless pictures.  But now, it's okay - even though it's really not okay - if I lose my phone, b/c I won't have to worry about my pictures.  Every picture I take is automatically stored online through photobucket, and all i have to do is download the app again, on my new phone and "Bada-boom...Bada-bing" all my pics are back! :o) Great app!
169, It's not the best movie I've seen, however I liked it. Could have been done better. Too many times you hear the f* word in this movie, too many. And the battles are way too bloody. Scenes are unrealistic. Example: when a guy on the horse drags a man into a tree with his face, face breaks into pieces. Also a fault when a woman without tongue suddenly screams. In reality she wouldn't be able to scream. The battles may not be very realistic looking, but story is fine.
170, The Colloidal Oatmeal in the Aveeno Products is the reason I keep buying them, even if I'm not overly excited about smoothing petrolatum over my skin.I wish these products were all natural. I have noticed the oatmeal has a calming effect on my skin and the addition of Lavender, Chamomile and Ylang-Ylang is emotionally healing.The minute you put this cream on your skin, you can feel the difference. Your skin becomes calm, soothed and smooth and silky. Perfect for after a shower or during the day when you need a calming moment.~The Rebecca Review
171, MONSTERS is a love story / drama w/ sci-fi / horror elements. It's strength lies in the story and character development, NOT in explosions or mindless action. So, don't expect ID4 meets CLOVERFIELD. MONSTERS is mostly (90%) about the journey of the two protagonists through the "infected zone" of Mexico. We are shown the devastating aftermath and human cost in the wake of the alien creatures more than the creatures themselves. Yes, there are a couple of JURASSIC PARK moments, but they are few. What keeps this movie from being another ALTITUDE is the excellent writing and depth of personality of the male and female leads. Well worth watching...
172, As another reviewer mentioned, the iphone adapter becomes stressed and breaks over time. Mine lasted about 6 months, and I'm very gentle with my electronics. The plastic release tabs on the side both broke, and then the main clamshell came apart. I really like the CallPod because it allows charging of our Blackberry, cell phone, and iphone all at the same location with only one plug in the wall. But the quality of this adapter isn't that great.Written by Arthur Bradley, author of the "Handbook to Practical Disaster Preparedness for the Family."
173, This is a nice looking case, the only problem I had with this was that the inside is not painted, looks like they tried using just enough paint on the outside to make it look good. I guess it doesn't really matter once the case is snaped on to the phone but it still bugs me to see the poor quality...If you must buy this style of case, you might want to consider one called Kroo Shell, I'm not sure if they make it for the 1st Gen iPhone though.
174, I have the older version of this charger, which is a little larger and holds slightly less charge. I absolutely love this thing. I can't tell you often it's gotten my phone through a long day, either when I'm traveling or just out for the day and unable to get to a wall outlet. This battery can charge my phone three times (your mileage may vary) and I've also used it on flights for my ipad. Definitely a must have item if you'd be lost without your phone!The only warning I'd give is that the battery tends to get hot. I imagine that's typical of all such devices but since I've never heard another, I really can't say. It's not so hot that it seems dangerous, but I do try to make sure that it has some breathing room while charging so it doesn't overheat.
175, This is a great item to have on the side of your changing table.  I have both a diaper stacker and this.  The diaper stacker is great for a decorative accent and storage of tons of diapers.  The diaper depot is great for holding those diapers handy for the middle of the night changing.  Also, the wipes warmer fits right on top in the perfect reach.  The side compartment, they can come off, hold all the perfect necessities like Desitin and baby lotion.  I held Alcohol pads in them for the umbilical cord for the first two weeks.  This is really a handy little organizational item.  It is clear so it doesn't really stand out.  I have two.  One upstair in the nursery and one downstairs in the play room.  I highly recommend it.
176, Ok, i won't get into the famous u2 red rocks performance , we all know its great. But this review focuses on the dvd release itself.. First off, the sound mix is great. but the picture is another story. It claims to be remastred and regraded picture, but its not that great. First off its got the one thing i hate about bad remastering dvds (GRAIN).. and its really bad on the sections that are from the original, but the added songs which are mostly in the beginning look better. Out of control , twilight, two hearts and into the heart.. look fine. but you can tell a diffrence in picture on these songs compared to the rest... I just really hate grain.... surprised they didnt notice this. oh well, at least its on dvd.... and the colors are a tad washed out...
177, I ordered these earrings and received tons of compliments. I love them. The blue topaz is vibrant. Then one day I lost one of the earrings! I was so devastated I had to order another pair. They are so affordable-- that was not a problem at all! These feel so high quality, not chintzy at all. They look GREAT with denim and also are fabulous when dressing up. Very versatile. I LOVE these earrings and they are even prettier than the photo depicts.  You won't be disappointed.
178, Despite all the Reviews and high praise, alost of that comes from advertising and hype remember. Not saying this oil filter is bad, i love it, but it is very expensive for a resin type fiber filter. It will filter well, but not as well as say, glass enchanced nano filters from other brands, especially at this price range. Those other filters may not have as high flow rates, but i do not run a racing dry oil sump system in my car. Some good things about this filter though, it has a thick steel casing and a removal nut, i personally just use my hands to twist off, but for some, the nut can be a real help in taking the filter off. This is a high quality product, do not get me wrong, its just this filter does not fit my situation as well as say, a mobil1 or purolator filter.
179, This looked like a great deal. I have a boombox with a 1/8&#34; (3.5 mm) input for external audio sources which I wanted to use for my tablet computer and a couple of other portable devices. All I got was distorted mono sound or stereo sound with a 60 cycle hum depending on how far in I pushed the plug. Pushing it all the way in only produced hum. Tried it on a number of devices. Same results. My guess is that the internal wires are not connected at the right spots in the plugs. I bought a shorter, more expensive cable that works. Buyer beware.
180, My dad bought this album, and I thought anything my dad listens to can't be that good. But Listened to it when i was alittle older and realized how  amazing it is. It really stands the test of time, and is really one of the best r and b/ and or pop music albums ever made. I mean mercy mercy gives me chills. What's goin on is classic. Wholy wholy is an interesting tune. Marvin Gaye really hit his creative peak at this point. I think the only other R and B album that came out during this time that can compare is Al Green's Let's Stay Together. I'm still glad he's at least around to make music. HOw can anybody not like this album or not think that it has any depth. I think any fan of music in general will love this album. Most of the music is slow,but really works for his voice and is indeed very poetic. You should go and buy the album,its worth it!
181, The size is exactly as you'd expect. They aren't skinny pants and aren't really baggy. The waiste fits well and doesn't dig into my sides like many pants do. I hard to bend over to pick something up and they had an obvious stretch to them so I had no fear of tearing/ripping. They're a nice set of pants for work or play. I ordered Khaki and will now order black and charcoal as a follow up order.Updated:I now have charcoal and black and they fit just as well. They are a fine quality fabric for warm or chilly days.
182, These blades do look slightly more attractive than the framed OEMs on my 2006 Scion tC, but their performance is not as good. In the summer they work fine, but once the weather dips below 50, the larger blade starts to streak. I'm assuming that because it is a fairly large blade (26 inches on the tC) the factory mechanism isn't strong enough to push it down. Now that the weather is getting cold again (already snowed twice and it's only October) I will be looking for OEM refills. They are made by a company called NWB.
183, Rick James achieved multiplatinum status, unquestionable street cred and superstardom with this release and with good reason, &quot;Street Songs&quot; remains his most consistent, confident and entertaining LP. All the big hits are here from the punk-funk of the biggest hit &quot;Superfreak&quot; to the terrific, guitar driven &quot;Ghetto Life&quot; (one of his greatest vocal performances ever)to the indictment of crooked law enforcement &quot;Mr. Policeman&quot; and his classic, heated duet with Teena Marie &quot;Fire &amp; Desire&quot;(and I literally mean &quot;Fire&quot;, Lady T recorded her vocals while suffering from a 100-plus degree fever) every track here is essential. Slick Rick owned the early 80's with this album. &quot;Street Songs&quot; belongs in any good collection.
184, This program makes it easy to keep track of what you eat every day and how much exercise you manage to accomplish, but to me, the program itself is a little buggy. I've only been using it for about two weeks. My favorite foods list seems to be full and recent additions seem to have disappeared. Also, the things I eat for dinner one night might become lunch the next day and it won't let me copy and paste, I have to redo the search each and every time I want to add it to a new meal, Since it is now not showing up in my existing list, (if I for example, have the same thing for dinner two nights in a row),  that means I have to do a new search in order to add it to the SAME list! I love this program but it's not perfect.
185, For the price you can't beat this item. I bought and returned a couple of changing table hanging organizers. This one is what I settled on. It fits my badger basket changing table just fine. I was really looking for something small to keep wipes and ointments handy in. I like that I can also for my small prefolds (for cloth diapering) in where the diapers go. They don't fit perfect, but well enough that I'm happy! I paid less than $9 for this item so I really have no complaints. It serves its purpose!
186, Robinson gets the science fairly right in this plodding sci-fi series, but the story he tells is largely unmoving and the characters themselves tend to the cardboard cutouts that are the bane of decent science fiction. The terraforming Mars idea has been done many times, and often better. This one, however, is longer.The best part of the series is the specifics of the science, especially in this first book. I agree with others that Robinson seems to run out of decent ideas in his sequels, often killing off characters, including some of the most interesting ones, for seemingly no purpose. Also, there is also a whole semi-immortality thing going on that eventually grows tiresome.BTW, having recently read The Martian Chronicles by Ray Bradbury, I found that to be a far more meaningful work, even though the science itself was preposterous. Bradbury's stories have far more human truth, and are far more literary, than Red Mars and others of its ilk. And they come in at several hundred fewer pages.
187, All Disney Singalongs are classics, but this one is unique enough to be worth reviewing separately because in a way, it's the next best thing to actually going to the most magical place on Earth. Extremely catchy, memorable songs that everyone (not just kids) will end up singing and delightful footage of all corners of the theme park are the biggest reasons to own the video. Costume-character people, from the main Disney gang to Chip and Dale, Roger Rabbit, Pooh Bear, & various movies such as Mary Poppins, Alice in Wonderland, The Jungle Book, Peter Pan, Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, and lots of others dance around with happy children and have a blast like no other running willy-nilly all over Disney--riding things, eating things, and watching a sweet parade. This tape brings back fond memories of Disneyworld (& also makes you want to return ASAP.)
188, I received the sure deluxe newborn to toddler tub at my shower, But my little girl outgrew the newborn side at 3 months, but was to small for the toddler side. Here bum would pop up over the plastic part that is suppose to keep her from going under. I  bought this tub and it is great! It is the only tub where she has been able to kick her feet and it holds her so i can bathe her with two hands. It is big, but fits perfectly in our tub and gives her so much room to play around. It has made the both of us so happy i only wish it was padded, but other then that it has been great!
189, I've tweaked mine and added 3rd party programs, but you can't get around the fact that it's pretty darn hard to make a simple phone call without the stylus, and it's especially frustrating to use the keypad for call options (e.g. voice mail) once your call is connected.  This just plain sucks.Basic phone call operations turn into a two handed procedure, pretty dangerous when you're on the road.After 5 months with this phone, I'm really missing a phone that has a keypad.  I've gone back to my Nokia 73 and will continue shopping for a better Windows Mobile device...
190, I have used this product before except I bought it at my hair salon.  That one worked well.  So well, that I decided to buy again except I saw this one online and it was cheaper.  But, this one purchased online got all over my hands as soon as I touched my hair lightly, got on my shirt when I pulled it over my head, dripped down the side of my face when I perspired.  Awful.  Wish I could return it but I didn't pay that much so let's just say its one lesson learned.
191, I needed to remount the passenger side door molding on my Envoy, and I was hoping this would make the job a little easier.  Not the case!  After removing the door mold from the painted finish I used this product in conjunction with a plastic scraper.  Until I scraped most of the adhesive off with the scraper this did almost nothing.  It helped get the last little bit of adhesive residue off, but most of the result was due to &#34;hard labor&#34;.  Removing the adhesive from the plastic mold was even worse.  It did not seem to distort or discolor the finish on either part, but it was only marginally helpful in getting the adhesive to release.  I would have to agree with some other reviewers that there might be a less expensive product that would do about as well.  I hate the thought of having to do the other molding sections.  Be sure to use in a well ventilated area (outside would be best).
192, I purchased two of these mattress pads two years ago for my son's crib.  This pad is so easy to put on and take off the mattress.  It fits a standard crib mattress PERFECTLY, and lays nice and flat.  It washes up easily, and does NOT shrink!  It's soft and durable, and it has NEVER leaked!  Oh, and compared to many mattress pads that cost up to $19.99 each- this pad is a super deal!I was so pleased with this product that I'd buy it all over again- and I will.  We are expecting TWINS this spring, and I plan on purchasing two more mattress pads for our second crib!I reccommend purchasing TWO for those middle of the night messes, that way you can change the sheets and pad in the middle of the night and not worry about washing the soiled pad till you wake up the next morning.  :)
193, I bought the 45s of this show and wore them out when I was in the eighth grade, and that was a few (ahem) years ago. It is just amazing to see this famous show with the original cast...a young and sexy Eartha Kitt, a hilarious Alice Ghostley, a multi-talented Robert Clary...and oh those songs, "Love is a Simple Thing," "Monotonous," "I'm in Love with Miss Logan," "Santa Baby" and the whole bunch. I'm not kidding myself. This is not one of the greatest musicals of all time. But it produced a stageful of youngsters who became a stageful of stars: Paul Lynde, Carol Lawrence, and the list goes on. I found it an absolute joy to watch,and this is one DVD that I'm sure will get more than one play.
194, I bought these for VERY cheap thinking that they would last a little while and then I would go out ansd spend some real money on headphones......  Well, I have had these for I think over a year now and they still work great!  I use them mainly for talking on the phone while driving and have been told people don't even notice I'm using them.  I still have two pairs (only because I threw one pair in a fit of rage) and they work perfectly.  The sound quality for music isn't great but if you want good sound quality, you're going to have to spend some money.Overall, these are great headphones and I would highly recommend.
195, So I have been using the charger and it is unbelievable!Pros:Light weightShape is made so that it fits great in your hand.Holds an amazing charge!charges in 6 hours so over night you dont even feel it.The LED light and red laser are actually coming in handy surprisingly. theLED is a great use but the red laser is just entertaining.Cons:I only have 1 con to this fantastic devicethe way you turn on the LED, laser, and the product itself unless someonereads the manual, no one would know how to do it.
196, In what is easily the best book I've ever read, Tom Clancy creates a cast of characters that trancend the series of Jack Ryan.John Kelly, In what is easily the best book I've ever read, Tom Clancy creates a cast of characters that trancend the series of Jack Ryan.John Kelly, the main character of the novel, is easily the most astounding person I've ever read about. From his times in Vietnam as part of the Third Special Operation Group, to the harrowing tale embodying the main plot of Without Remorse, you just can't help but be taken away with the perfect machismo and badass-ness of the character.The storyline in itself is excellent, keeping you turning the pages as the action comes hard and fast, packaged with much of Clancy's trademark informative prose.I would reccomend to all who love a good action / military read.
197, This gives procedural dramas a bad name. If you're expecting something akin to Law and Order, you aren't going to get it here. Basically it is mundane and repetitive in the worst way. The way the storylines are annoying because it goes back and forth showing the prosecutor's side of the story and the defense's side. Plus there is no police investigation of the crimes.Bad formatting, storylines have been done to death on other shows, predictable endings. All around it could have been so much better but whoever came up with the scripts and format is an idiot. I only gave it a chance and watched a bit because I like Maura Tierney.
198, Best boot that you can  buy for the money.  I have boots that I paid twice as much that are not as good. This is my second pair. My older pair was beginning to show their age. Only thing negative - I can't wear until my sore toe heals up. They are pretty stiff in toe area. I cleaned up my old broke-in pair and will have to wear the new ones  at a later date. I might try taking a block of wood and soften up the toe.
199, This app has a very awkward interface which requires too much entry.  It also does not recognize general search criteria as it will return several topics which are all closely related but not exact.  It needs more intelligence in pattern recognition so that the user does not have to enter much information.  As an example, I entered Wheaties and thought that this should be a specific product that is widely recognized, but not so in this app.  I would suggest going back to the drawing boards as the entry of food products should be done in a way that greatly simplifies the user experience.I removed the app from my Kindle Fire as it was too onerous to use.
200, Laura's family sends her off to Candleford to work in the post office with the postmistress. At first, it seems like a cruel thing to take a young girl away from her family, all she's ever known, to go to work with some strangers in another town. But Laura gets over her initial shock and fright and she catches on and takes to the job. From there, the story goes back and forth between the two towns; characters are brought in and out, but the thread of Lark Rise and Candleford is maintained. If you grew up in a small town, you will relate to these stories. If you grew up in a big city, you will see how small towns care for their own.
201, Love the premise of this storyline.  Two cities that are close to each other with those from wealth and the tenants to the Squire and landlord.  It revolves around the postoffice where Dorcas is mistress and cousin to one of the tenants in Lark Rise.  Candleford is where the postoffice is located and as a favor to her cousin, Dorcas takes on Laura Timmons, the eldest daughter.  Twists and turns revolve around the love interest between Dorcas and Timothy the Squire (who is married to some else).  Then there is William, the starch, stern religous man who is a mail carrier and Zilla the house maid (who looks older then dirt and is set in her ways as well).  Much fun, romance and underlying polotics take you and a fun-filled journey in Lark Rise to Candleford.
202, This is a fairly unique and highly-praised TV movie designed, like Orson Welles' radio broadcast of WAR OF THE WORLDS, as if it were real coverage of a nuclear terrorist event on the East Coast of the U.S.  More realistic than its contemporary, THE DAY AFTER, this film scared the network enough that they kept running disclaimers throughout its presentation stating that it was not an actual news event.  If that description and the subsequent Emmies aren't enough to whet your appetite, I'd say this is just that much more scary in the post-9/11 era. Not a well known TV movie, but it seems even less like fiction now with its urban nuclear terrorist threat and non-stop news coverage of the events.  Worth seeing.
203, I will not say this is a miracle cream, I have always had younger looking skin and wrinkle remover is not something I need. But as a light moisturizer this product is great. My skin feels very soft and a little goes a very long way! In the winter I get very dry patches of skin on my chest and jaw line this cream has helped it immensely before I was having to go to the doctor who was giving me creams used to treat moderate psoriasis but this works just as well and  is much cheaper than the prescription.
204, i am most likely to play this record after watching mtv promote ashley simpson for the fiftieth time. in a rage, i blast it in my car and scream "yea steve!" real loud. i only listen to "power of independent trucking", "l dopa", "colombian necktie", "ergot", "fish fry", and "pavement saw" because they are clearly the best. in an effort to become more hardcore, i then go eat some battery acid. then some motor oil. then some aids.
205, A few moths ago, the check engine light of our 2006 (190,000 mile) Volvo V50 came on.  After checking with our local garage, which diagnosed the problem with &#34;something catalytic converter&#34;-related (and hearing the potential repair costs), the mechanic suggested trying this CRC Guaranteed To Pass Emissions Test Formula first.  Well, thus far it appears to have worked.  The check engine light has not been lit for several months now.  As the mechanic explained: &#34;At worst, this product doesn't harm the ergine.&#34;
206, I've been using the battery tender for the past month 24/7. I have it hooked up to a motorcycle battery while I am restoring a bike. It has several safety precautions in place to make sure accidents do not happen. There are two cord hook ups (one being alligator clamps, the other being a circular terminal) that both use a water resistant two pole connector. Both cords also have inline fuses that come with a 7.5amp fuse in place. The charger brings the battery to 100% charge then essentially turns itself off and watches the battery until it drops to 80%. Once the battery is at 80% the charger engages and brings the battery back to 100%. This is why it is called a battery tender and it essential for keeping the battery in good health.Mine is yet to fail me and has not sparked or caused any explosions yet. 5 stars for the good build quality as well as having two different hook-up styles.
207, I've owned this video for several years and spent several years trying to track it down and persisted because this video takes one on a mental journey where you lose yourself completely in the imagery and the sounds in a visual trip accentuated by the brilliant experimentation in music created by Pink Floyd in their earlier years.  If you are a serious Pink Floyd fan this video is a must have that for me rivals &quot;The Wall&quot; but in a very different direction that is just as unique and profound in the creative genius of Pink Floyd.
208, I live in a climate where humidity of 10% or less is not uncommon.  The skin really suffers but using this product has put an end to the dryness on my face.  I faithfully use it daily (sometimes both morning and night) and it makes my skin feel hydrated, plump and velvety.  I have been using it for many years and it has kept my skin looking fresh and not aging like I am sure it would if I hadn't used it.  I have even taken some to my mother-in-law (in England) and she loved it, too.  You will not be disappointed with this regenerating serum--it is the best thing you can buy without a prescription!
209, This app has a lot of data on most foods. You can even scan the bar code of the food your eating, and it will bring everything up for you, you just have to hit the "add to my diary" and you are good to go. The greatest thing about this app is that it really makes you realize what you eat. A stick of gum here,a coke there,a pop with lunch, etc, all those little things add up. Use my fitness pal, and you will find yourself thinking if you really need that cookie or not. It will also help you keep track of your activities (I have a fitbit, so it a automatically uploads the data to the app). I highly recommended it. I have it on my smart phone, computers and kindle.
210, What a great product this is!!!  Perfect clarity, small package, sweet all around, I can find nothing bad to say about 'Etymotic Research HF2 Hands-Free Earphones / Headset'.  If you are looking for a compact solution for listening to MP3s from your iPod or phone this is a wonderful product.  Pricey? Yes but you get what you pay forHeadphones come with lots of other replacement ear buds as well, this is sonic marvel that will blow you away!***** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
211, So let's face it, the advantage of this product is the scent, pure and simple.  There are many less expensive dish detergents that do the same or even better job but don't have this wonderful lavender aroma that envelops you as you do the dishes.  It takes a chore and makes it just a little bit more pleasant, as the gentle scent of lavender wafts upwards while you scrub dishes.  And then it rinses away, cleanly... 100% gone.  No residue in my experience.If you want a little luxury in your kitchen, try a bottle of this.  Often it's on sale at Marshalls in the home section if you just want to try one bottle before you commit to a case of 6.  But I'm hooked on this stuff!
212, ...in medical bills! Previously, we had a cheap wood, stationary gate in our hallway. I must have hefted my pregnant self and my 10 month old over that gate a hundred times a day and it was taking a serious toll on my back and knees. After about the 10th time I nearly fell over the darn thing, I went to find a new gate and saw this one. Next day I picked up at BRU (I had to get the extender peice too) and installed it.WONDERFUL. Sturdy, tall, nice to look at and it opens effortlessly. Couldn't be more thrilled. Everyone who has used it loves it because there is no fussing with latches or handgrips. Just step and nudge.
213, this guy is like the master of hip hop.  his words were so true and full of meaning.  there just isnt hip hop like this anymore.  i wanna hear more songs like wonder why they call u and brendas got a baby.  songs about the ghetto but they teach a lesson.  all of tupacs cds are true masterpieces but this one is probably his best one.  there will never be another tupac.  what a shame.  but now i wanna see a female tupac, a woman to rise up the way he did and have a true meaning to their rap.  oh well maybe one day well see one until then...
214, I really don't get it! I always order the same size sweat shirts and hooded shirts from Hanes but somehow the sizes are always different. Also this batch had the label, the previous ones had no label, just the print inside. I am kind of picky how these (for me oversized) shirts fit, and unfortunately these are just BIG. Shoulders are wider, waist band is wider and they just look as if I wear something from my &#34;big brother&#34;. Hanes might have different factories and some just cut larger.
215, This thing works with in my 1999 Camry, Replacing it is easy, save 60% by comparing to the OEM one. Get back more MPG after fixing the code. But I still get the code from time to time, Resetting it and it's gone. NO sure if it's the DIY cabling or the car. But I would recommend you to get the one that has the cable already connected. If you get a Sensor failure code, make sure you fix it asap. otherwise you are wasting gas.
216, CAUTION:  To get an entire product usable on your device you are likely to have to deal with TWO, maybe MORE, separate vendors, shipments, multiple shipping charges, and hard to find specs on what tip fits what Exactly which devices.  NO ONE cares enough to really help you out.  Returns of some part(s) are likely, and add more to cost and to your wait for a fully functional product.  It is NOT the product, it is the AMAZON and SUB-VENDOR system that creates a mess.I would avoid this product like poison!
217, I found &quot;Red Mars&quot; to be a rather interesting book on the colonization on Mars.  The descriptions in the book are pretty detailed (to be honest, a couple of times a got a bit bored) and this adds to the general realism of the book. Personaly, I found the scientific details of the book quite interesting (maybe one of its strongest points), the characters pretty detailed (and most of the time quite believable) and the plot rather interesting.  As another reader said, the book is definitely successful as a thought experiment; I believe this expresses in the most accurate way my impression from &quot;Red Mars,&quot; as well as the other books in the series.  In any case, reading this book made me curious enough to continue with the next books on the series (Green Mars, Blue Mars).
218, This is one of my favourite lip balms.  It really is a very basic one, but it's soothing if they are a little sore, and it really does put moisture back into dry lips.  It's PABA free, and has a good sun block in it so it's great during summer time, but definately in winter when your lips might be dryer, it's a big help.  It goes on smoothly and doesn't clump up which is great.  The one thing I can't understand, is why it's so hard to find in drugstores because it's not discontinued, but just not in big supply.Give it a go if you've been allergic to other brands or if you find other brands too heavy.  This is so good and does a fantastic job.  I really love this one.
219, All three of the videos from KISS are awesome 80's music video gems! Of the three, Reason To Live is the greatest one! The song, written by Paul Stanley and Desmond Child, is (in my opinion) their greatest song ever....and is, yes, like KISS' big hit: Beth....another ballad....but just listen to the words and music....absolutely incredible!!!! It makes me feel very good to be alive, every time I hear it! :) The video is stunning and gives the song a memorable picture each time it's heard on my Crazy Nights CD. The other 2 music videos: Crazy Crazy Nights and Turn On The Night are full throttle rockers that show the band electrifying in concert and charging up the crowd! I can't wait until these music videos find their way to a KISS video compilation DVD....it sure will sell alot of copies!
220, It's installed, had to cut the lines didn't have a choice for my vehicle.  Happy with this item.  For my vehicle the upper line was the return line to the transmission.  Opposite of what people generally believe.  Adequate adapters were not supplied.  My vehicle has a quick coupler fitting on the radiator.  No adapters were included for that, that's why I had to cut the lines and clamp on to the line.Happy with the item though.  It's working.
221, As a Beatle fan this film is a must-have and a testament to the marvel, charm, and magic of The Beatles. The live performances from the Ed Sullivan shows are alone worth the price; the picture is clear and the sound is excellent, and I was (I'm not embarrassed to admit) a bit misty-eyed as I watched the lads perform some of their best songs from the early days. These ain't some lip-sync'd, fake American Bandstand performances. The concert scenes are something else-they are grainy, dark and barely audible, but then again, you won't really care, because it's great to see the boys perform live anytime. In this day and age of no-name flash-in-the-pan rock bands, bland singer-songwriters, idiotic dance music, and tuneless, mindless and obnoxious rap, it is refreshing to listen and watch THE masters perform real music.
222, This was a total piece of garbage.  Several things are wrong.1.  It doesnt fit every changing table.  When I attach it to mine, it tilts downward and is not level at all.  You need to have a bottom slat or base to support it under the top slat it will go onto.2.  The side compartments keep falling off because they dont attach they just fit over the edges.3.  The biggest complaint is that the wipe tray does not fit every wipe box or wipe warmer and we have the same brand name wipe warmer that made this product.4.  Consider that you will be taking away 5 inches of walk space around your changing table after you put this hunk of plastic onto it.If you have your changing table in a small area or corner of a room, this makes a difference.What a cheaply made piece of plastic.Pass this up and buy a wall shelf to go over the changing table instead.
223, I really like this tub for my sitting baby. She still manages to swish herself around face down, despite the little barrier that sits between the baby's legs. But that's why you're never supposed to leave babies unattended in the bath. They can manage all sorts of crazy things when left to their own devices.The only reason I didn't give this tub 5 stars is because the white tub develops a little brown spot where her bum sits. I clean her thoroughly with wipes before each bath, so I'm not sure why this is happening, and she's never pooped in the tub. I've tried scrubbing it with baby-safe detergents, but it won't come off. It seems to be permanently stained. I'm too afraid to try bleach in that spot, since it's where the most sensitive part of her body rests in the tub. If I could have gotten another color for the same price, I would have.
224, I finally got around to installing this thing, 4 months after I purchased it.It works very well for use in a 25 foot travel trailer, moves a lot of air and has 3 settings.High setting is loud, but not nearly as loud as an air conditioner.This is the basic non remote control model which is a bit cheaper.The product is sturdy and assembled easily. Not a bad do-it-yourself project.It took the greater part of a morning to remove the old fan and install this one.
225, This has been a beauty staple of makeup artists and mascara fans for years and I cannot for the life of me figure out why. I guess if you're lookin for a mascara to give your lashes a darker color and nothing more, you'd be satisfied with this. But most women buy mascara to lengthen and/or thicken their lashes and this just doesn't do that. It doesn't clump, but it also doesn't do anything else for your lashes. I really tried to give it a chance but it ended up in the garbage. Such a waste. Good thing it's pretty cheap.
226, My favorite feature is that you can apply in sunshine, although I try not to but I have a life, you know.  Anyway, it protects well, lasts a very long time (I'm not sure about one year - maybe if the car is kept in a garage), and it leaves a great polished look.I suggest using a clay bar, or the likes of one, to fully clean the paint before applying Nu Finish.  You don't have to do that but I'm just stubborn like that - if you're gonna spend a lot of time doing something good you might as well go the whole nine yards.
227, This eponymous album first came out in 1976, and it was a smash hit! In 2012 this album was re-released plus a whole lot of bonus materials - lots of alternate versions of her songs. As an added bonus, disc 2 ends with a ~15 minute interview with the great lady.This is a fun album. True, it does contain no less than three(!) versions of the Theme from Mahogany, but I did enjoy each one. Plus, the bonus songs like Together, Le Lo Li, and the fun songs Kiss Me Now and Go Where Your Mind Is are really wonderful. I really enjoyed this album, and think that any fan of the great Diana Ross will enjoy having it!
228, "Celeste Aida" is the big aria.  Any self-respecting tenor would use this aria to stir the audience into frenzy, as intended by Verdi.  When Domingo hit the big high note, he decided to cut it short and sat down.  And sat down he did.  He still got his usual ovation at the Met.  If it was at Parma, he would have been boo'ed off the stage, Domingo or not. I have to agree with three of the reviewers that this was a sub-par performance by Domingo.  Seven years earlier, in 1982, he did not cheat in his Deutsche Grammophon recording (available on CD). He was Domingo.One key performer can ruin an opera in one key aria!  Millo, Milnes, and Zajick were superb.Domingo has the last laugh, of course.  He lasted half a century by cheating here and there, whereas many of his colleagues lasted only half as long.
229, THIS CD IS ANOTHER CLASSIC RECORD BY THE INFAMOUS 2PAC/MAKAVELI. THIS 2CD SET FEATURES OVER 25 SONGS (27 TO BE EXACT) THAT NEED TO BE HEARD. IF YOU CAN'T FIND THIS CD ANYWHERE, YOU CAN GET THE &quot;DIGITALY REMASTERED&quot; VERSION, WITH THE &quot;2 OF AMERIKAZ MOST WANTED&quot; VIDEO. THIS CD SHOULD ALSO BE PICKED UP IF YOU SEE IT ANYWHERE. I HONESTLY ADVISE YOU TO LISTEN TO DISC 2 BEFORE DISC 1, BECAUSE DISC 2 EXPLAINS MORE ABOUT LIFE, DISC 1 EXPLAINS ABOUT DEATH ROW FEELINGS. BUT WHATEVER. BUY IT WHEN YOU CAN.
230, I got this for my baby shower and I LOVE-Love-Love it.  I put it on my kitchen table after filling under sink, and drain it from the easy-drain spout right into the sink when I am done.  My baby Amelia has been in it since week 1 and she is 3 months and still loves it.  She fits perfectly in the newborn side, and I feel safe she won't slip down.  I can easily bathe her alone without problems.  Highly recommended, especially since the tub grows with you and your baby.
231, I gave this 5 stars because it is what it is and it's what is sold all around in RV repair/sales shops...personally, I don't think it's so heavy duty, but it's the best one on the market. I've checked out many of them in my travels at RV stores and they cost much more than what I paid for this one. It works, it does mark easily so be careful about rubbing the hitch crank on it, but it is a good buy here on Amazon.com.
232, I'm 5'0&#34; and 130-140lbs, but I have larger thighs than typical for my height and weight. It makes purchasing and wearing thigh highs difficult and often unappealing. However, these are great. They are a bit too long, since this specific E/F size is meant for much taller customers, but its not as though the nylons are wrinkling and bunching all over, so you can't notice it. They fit great and the material on the band makes them stay up (and if you're untoned, will bunch your thighs a bit in the clinginess to stay up)
233, This shirt wasn't especially heavy, but it's thicker than what you would get in a typical pack of white undershirts, for example. It's pretty much the weight you would expect for a T-Shirt meant to be worn as a stand alone outer shirt, nothing more. And comfortable soft cotton, the stitching seems good quality, no flaws or loose threads, looks good. And the color hasn't bled at all, no blotches or spots now, still looks very good after owning it for 8 months.So really, just right for me.  If you want something extra heavy for warmth, this might not do.  But for me, it's exactly what I want, something to wear outdoors on a warm day, that's heavy enough and with enough quality that it's durable, looks good, and doesn't look cheap.
234, Most of these kind of backflush tank rinsers do not have a gate valve. They simply squirt water up into the tank (or attempt to), by the direction of the nozzle built into the device.However, there is only so far the water can go &#34;upstream&#34; into the holding tank with such a design. A rinser such as this is vastly superior as it includes a gate valve that you can use to block off the water flow.While that might not allow a high-pressure blast of water into the holding tank, and it could eventually overflow the holding tank into your RV if you are not paying attention, it at least rinses the tank better than not having one.I suggest therefore if you are going to use this item, pay close enough attention that you don't overflow the tank.
235, It&#34;s not the movie &#34;inside&#34; the movie that I rave about....it&#34;s these guys, who made Mystery Science Theater a real &#34;hoot&#34;, that I like in all the movies they&#34;ve done. Let&#34;s see....Mike Nelson and his robot friends....Crow, Gypsy, and Tom Servo. These robots remind of The Three Stooges...as robots! It had a great cultic run on TV between 1988-1999 and it looks even better on DVD. With a mighty shout of YES! I recommend it....not because of the movies that Mike and the bots are forced to watch....I like how the guys comment on those awful movies....THEY ARE A RIOT!
236, Apparently, a great value (can't speak to long-term durability).  From previous comments, I gathered that I should order one size smaller, and it worked out perfectly.  These sweatshirts are apparently marketed by various distributors and possibly even different manufacturers under the Hanes label.  Mine came from &#34;Hippo tails&#34;.  Addressing other complaints I read about (different manufacturers?&#34;, I bought one to check the fit at one size smaller (XL), then bought two more XLs in a later order.  All the ones I bought were 90% cotton and were very soft when worn next to skin.  Washing shrinkage wasn't all that noticeable.
237, I was impressed by the quality of this film. It was gorgeous, sensitive, understated, quiet, moving and real. The words were few and meaningful, the acting real.It's not for the kiddies and it's not for Transformer fans. Please watch something on the Sci Fi Channel instead. Monsters is a film for those who love honest stories and gorgeous cinema.YES! art films can have a plot and a story! Monsters once again proves that the best, most original and most moving films originate outside of the bloated, fly-blown carcass that is Hollywood.
238, Its good, but why does the description say &quot;and Facebook&quot;?It defaults to the most recent Tweets, not where I left. There's a setting for this which I have set properly, but it doesn't seem to always work.If someone re-tweets, and I want to follow the person who posted the original, it is very difficult. &quot;Profiles&quot; shows me the person who re tweeted (the person I'm already following) and not the originator. (unless there's several profiles in the tweet, then it includes the one I want.I do like the thumbnails for photos and videos.Good app with plenty of room for improvement.
239, great little app....very easy to find the foods that I eat and keep track of my diet....has fast food lists :( lol (which I shouldn't be needing but oh well--very nice to have them available),  as well as foods from grocery store...I can enter the number of servings easily enough...just recently started trying to lose weight so this is very informative about the calories I am eating...seems accurate...fairly easy to update even if I forget to do yesterdays, can go in and update quickly...it has goal weight tracker so it compares what I am eating to what I would weigh if I ate similar each day...also keeps track of my activities which are waayyy below what I should be but it doesnt knock me for that lol.  all in all very satisfied.  Using this app on my kindle fire hd 7".
240, this was the first video related item i came across by the floyd. that was about 12 years ago and this bad boys hasn't lost a single bit of lustre in all of that time. if your serious about the floyd this is a mind blowing  must have video. the live shots are spectacular and the interviews are  charming. being an advid collector of live floyd shows i would have to say  that there a few studio touch ups to the music but this still represents a  well captured era of the ever evolving floyd. enjoy.
241, Only Clancy would make a serial killer the hero of a book.  The truly sad part is how many other characters in professional positions look the other way.  In the past, I have enjoyed Clancy's works.  This one went over the limits good taste.  I added the second star because like many Clancy works it is well written.  I did finish it.  Readers should be cautioned that it is a disturbing concept. In the real world, this hero would be seen as an evil villian of Manson or Gacy dimensions.I will admit a personal bias.  I am a strong supporter and advocate of local police departments.
242, Martin's fifth book in this series is more of the same. It builds upon characters you think you know. There is an amazing amount of depth in this series and book five begins to reveal some of my favorite characters, especially Arya. It's not like every other fantasy out there where the good guys always win and the bad guys are the epitome of evil. It's real life, winners and losers, shades of good and evil.You'll find yourself loving, hating, loathing and pitying, and that's all on one character.Enjoy!
243, The iTorch feels nice and sturdy in your hand and also comes with a convenient carrying pouch to keep the battery pack and usb cable together. The built in laser pointer is definitely a handy addition to the power pack that is great for presentations. The added led flashlight is also useful. However, it isn't as bright as I would have liked. I like the fact that the battery pack charges by microusb. This makes it much easier to charge when you are traveling as almost everything has a USB port. When using the battery pack to charge my iPhone, it was very fast. The added capacity that the battery pack provides gave me more than enough power to be unplugged from the wall for the whole day and more.Overall, I am very impressed with the iTorch IMP52D and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a USB Battery Pack.
244, Our little one is rolling and starting to crawl, so we bought two of these gates, one for the top of our walk-up stairs, and one for the hallway.  They are fantastic.  You have to do two things to open the gate -- push down on the foot pedal while pushing the gate forward, but because you can do these without your hands, it is perfect for when you are carrying your little one in your arms.  The foot pedal also requires a substantial push, so there is no way that the  baby (or a pet) would be able to do so on his or her own.  The material is very sturdy, so even if a toddler tried to pull herself up on the gate, it would not come undone.  The gate door also works both ways, an important feature.The one negative as far as I can tell is that when coming up the stairs, it takes a little extra coordination to step on the foot pedal.Definitely recommended.
245, I had never seen Doctor Who before this year. I was browsing instant videos and thought I would see why this show has been so popular for so many years. I have now watched seasons 1 through 4 (of the new series) and have started season 5. I love this show.Travelling through time with the Doctor and his companion is a real treat. It seems like there is something for every one - adventure, aliens (some scary, some not), love stories, intriguing story lines and a great cast of actors. Enjoy!
246, For the price this bag is great.  It's big enough to carry everything I need for myself and my dog when we go to the park, or store.  The Velcro on the front is lacking and you might want to sew on a small buckle if you carry a high price PDA.  It's a small enough, big enough "Every Day Carry" bag.  The bag is about 7 inches tall and 6 inches wide.  I got the black cause I wear a lot of black, so most people don't even notice I have it on.  Well, except this one day I forgot to wear clothes, and everyone made a nice comment about the bag.
247, When this film first aired on television after Christmas in 1967, critics panned it for being incomprehensible gibberish. It certainly wasn't what the folks at home were used to for their holiday television. In hindsight, we can see &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; for what it is: a slightly sluggish but fanciful art film, filled with engaging music videos and bits of offbeat comedy. This film predates MTV by a good 13 years, and includes great Beatles recordings (I strongly recommend the &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; soundtrack album.) It remains today a great period piece, and a pleasant piece of surreal filmmaking.
248, I wear a size 4 - 6 or small in misses' clothing or a 5 - 7 or small in juniors' clothing.  Because these shorts are made of a 50/50 poly-cotton jersey knit, I ordered them a size larger than I normally wear--medium--thinking that even though they initially might be a bit big, they would shrink enough to be a good fit on me. Unfortunately, the medium was far too small for me.  In fact, I'd guess that the medium would be a perfect fit for someone who normally wears a small.  I have reordered the shorts in a large because they are nicely made and exactly what I need.  My only complaint is that the sizing seems very inaccurate.  They definitely run about a size smaller than other knit shorts in the same size.
249, I chose this, because this has flash light and laser point. I guess they will be useful in daily life, but...1. 5200mah capability is good. ( one iphone and extra device..but not full 2 devices at one time)2. holding phone and this item..is not comfortable. ( not recommeded things thoud)3. And compared to other 5200 mah batter pack, i think this does not have full competency. I do not have scientific data to prove this. Based on recharging process, i felt many times.
250, 3 1/2The influential mega-producer whose own musical projects were almost always more important from a stylistic and production angle rather then a compositional one had most success with Shellac's first major release for several reasons. Primarily though it remains the tightest and least pretentious offering from the awkward front-man due to a concentrated focus on the minimal dynamics, showcasing the band at their tense-filled best. Of course, a majority of these "exercises" are not able to transcend the confines of their repetitious calculations, which at the time sounded no less then innovative. Still, Albini and company are far less interested in trying to break the mold then they are simply breaking it, which leads to a less strained record. Sadly the unique mechanics introduced by the trio did not seem to evolve much past their first outing, reiterating the case for At Action Park to be your one Shellac purchase.
251, There are no surprises in this Law and Order series with predictable plots and characters except for a little more sunshine, LA location wise.  Now that "Criminal Intent" is off the air and "SVU" has become wooden, that is, everyone is phoning in their performances, I don't see this West Coast version coming up with anything fresh.  After a lot of years, I am crying "Uncle!".  Not even $1.99 per episode can entice.  I would rather be reading a good book.
252, I hope this series doesn't go nuts with government conspiracies.  That possibility is certainly there.  The premise though, of aliens, who look very much like us but have some significant differences, is more interesting that I thought it would be.  This is because there are so many alien-ufo shows and most of them get tedious covering the same old ground.  This has some very exciting adventure sequences with the very best being a plane crash that is swapped out from the Miami area to the southwest desert. There is also an alien deep inside the CIA.  I recommend you give this one a try.  It is ambiguous about whether they mean us ill or not.  It may well remain ambiguous, which may remain truer to how it might actually come about if such a thing were possible.
253, This is one of those rare cds where every song is good.  u don't have to skip past nuthin.  This is a classic r n b  album with alot of ballads.  The songs speak for themselves.  I like the remix for "Wrap Your body Tight" better than the album version and I don't think it's availabe on cd. What else can I say?  Johnny Gill has that good love vibe of the early ninties, check it out and hear for yourself.
254, The Beatles Magical Mystery Tour was a mess anyway, but this DVD does nothing to help its reputation.  This version claims to be "Digitally Remastered"...by `digitally' they must mean that someone ran a finger over the film before they copied it because the quality is very very poor.  But with all the flaws this DVD has, a decent version (as of 2011) has yet to be made available and so if you want to see "Fool on the hill", "I am the walrus" and "Your mother should know" in their full context, this is the only option available. I have it, but I wish I had waited for some better copy to come along (even if it never does).
255, The New Trent iTorch is the smallest and lightest 5200mah external battery pack you will find anywhere.  It feels sturdy and solidly built.  This is a must have for anyone who finds themselves needing to charge their phone all the time.  I hate walking out the door with 40% left of battery life on my iPhone5 and having to not use my phone like I would like to in order to save battery.  Now I can use my phone when and where I want without worrying about the battery dying.The only issue I have is the battery pack might not store as much juice as advertised.  I get about 1 full charge on my iPhone5 - it is advertised to provide 2-3 full charges.  I don't see that happening ever!  But this is still light, compact and easy to carry around all day in your pocket just in case you need some added power to your phone or other device.
256, This is like the lesser red haired brother no one talked about of Fringe. Acting was good except for a couple people who seemed emotionally detached. I know that people handle grief differently, but if I was told my family was murdered I think I would have done more than sit there quietly with a smile on my face. You might get that she didn't like her parents, well you would be wrong, she loved them. So you might see why I said the acting was good except in a couple areas. Its not a terrible show, but its not a great show either.
257, Okay....I admit, this film makes very little sense, confuses the crap out of you,  and its characters deserve a severe beating of some kind.....BUT  THAT'S JUST THE POINT!&quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot;  was a very  independent project of the Beatles, during their famous L.S.D period.  Unlike all of their popular films, this one is aimed at more of an  underground &quot;art&quot; audience. It is weird, creative and just plain  insane! Don't expect to see any lovable mop-tops in this film....if you  aren't open minded to strange things, don't even bother with this  one.However, the music videos are very rare and interesting! I love this  film, and find it very Influential!
258, I have a puggle and boxer, and neither one can jump this gate or accidentally open it. It's the best gate I've ever owned- and I've gone through a LOT of gates!! It is so easy to install- did it myself and I'm not usually good at putting things together. Easy!! Great when I'm taking groceries in the house and don't have an extra hand to fiddle with one of those tricky gate locks. LOVE IT!!! It doesn't leave "marks" on the trim or "damage" the walls... some reviewers must be over-tightening their gates if they're having that much trouble. It also has NEVER shifted out of place- ever... and I've had it in a high traffic area (where it's used over and over throughout the day)for nearly 3 months. Great gate- worth the money!
259, I have naturally light brown hair. Sun In is a great way for me to go blond that is very easy. Just spray it on, and head out into the California sun. I also feel Sun In gives my hair nice body and makes it fuller. People have commented on my hair, thinking I was a natural blond.I just wish they made a product to just do the roots of your hair. To spray from the bottle just the roots is alittle difficult.But overall, a very easy way to go blond with a natural look.
260, Clancy should stick with the techno stuff.  His attempt to show the more human side of his characters flops.  Kelly, and every other character, is one-dimensional.  It is simply too trite that a man could fall instantly in love with a hitchhiker, without our having any hint of what he really sees in her, then spend the rest of the book obsessed with avenging her death.  Not that the guys didn't deserve it, mind you.  He does play with the gray areas of justifiable actions outside the law, kind of a human super-hero vigilante for whom police are probably grateful behind closed doors.  But this book has the literary depth of your average Sergeant Fury comic book.
261, Simply Outstanding!!! This is the best Todd Rundgren concert dvd, I've seen so far. I have watched lots & lots of other concert dvd's by other musicians, and I'd have to say this is one of the best!!! Todd performs at his very best, he is really into this concert. The Tokyo crowd are really into the concert. Plus, there are lots, & lots of backup musicians, and 3 beautiful women dancers in tight, short, pink dresses. Everything is 1st Class!!!It has a approximate running time of 94 minutes.The song set:1.Real Man2.Unloved Children3.Parallel lines4.Can't Stop Running5.Compassion6.Secret Society7.Something to Fall Back on8.Love of the Common man9.Can We still be friends10.Mated11.The Waiting Game12.Love in Action13.Rock Love14.Hawking15.The Want of a Nail16.Hello It's Me (One of my favorite songs by Todd Rundgren, it doesn't sound exactly like the studio version here, but it is close. It is very well performed!!!17.I Love My LifeOverall, this is a great one, and I highly recommend it. Thanks!!!!
262, I was really disappointed in GRRM's latest effort. Dance with Dragons dragged on almost as bad as Feast for Crows. The plot of the Fire and Ice series makes little progress although many characters get fleshed out nicely. It is like buying a software upgrade that changes the menus to be clearer but does not advance the technology at all.I liked the character development but now GRRM will make us wait five more years and maybe he will figure out how to tie all these tales together to move the plot along. Tommen may die on the Iron Throne of old age before we find out who can unseat him.The series is almost like a soap in that you read about people dying and they pop back up alive in this book. Brandon Stark. Arya Stark, Theon Greyjoy, and a few others come back from the dead in this one.
263, So, the monsters are giant, walking, glowing, octopus, from outer space, and towards the end of the film you get to see them have sex. Oh no, I am not kidding. Despite its original title and awful special effects, Monsters, is not a bad story. It is however another example of a writer, using science fiction, to promote his own agenda and bigotry. The infected zone is Mexico and you're safe once you get to America. How about the largest man made structure in the world? A wall to keep the aliens out of the USA. As for the acting, it was two newcomers who actually were pretty good, but whom are easily overlooked. It's because Monsters is one of those movies, where you keep waiting for something to happen and it never does. It had good potential, but was just painfully boring...unless of course you enjoy octopus sex.
264, We have a standard fireplace hearth (no odd angles) that is about 6 feet wide and this has worked out great.  It sticks to the brick without a problem and my 11mo old plays on our fireplace constantly.  Since we bought these from BabiesRUs He has managed to get one piece off but considering he weighs 25lbs and has been pulling at these constantly I'm only taking 1 star off.  Otherwise this is doing a great job keeping him safe and reapplying the one piece isn't that hard.I bought the brown ones and both my wife and I actually think it looks pretty good on our gray brick fireplace and brown tables.  We also bought a 4 pack of their edge guards after the first two brands we tried couldn't survive my son's curiousity.  I'm sure my kid will still find some weight to hurt himself but hopefully now it won't be a call 911 kind of hurt.
265, The first self-produced album by a Motown female artist is an absolute delight.  Ms. Marie combines the styles of her first two producers Rick James and Richard Rudolph to create something entirely her own.  On the top-40 r&b/pop hit "I Need Your Lovin'" Teena's horn arrangement plays a musical "call and response" with Paul Riser's string arrangement, while passionate vocals and a catchy bassline anchor this magnificent piece of ear candy.  The ballads "Young Love", "Tune In Tomorrow" and the title track are well-written and thought provoking, and the slightly Latin groove of "You Make Love Like Springtime" allows Marie to playfully sing about her romantic bliss.  The only mistep here is "First Class Love", a song in which Marie tries a little too hard to "get down"  as they say back in the day.
266, I bought these for my boyfriend as a gift, not even knowing whether he would want them. He's been wearing them ever since!He says they are the most comfortable pants hes ever owned. He is 6'2, 34&#34; waist and 34&#34; inseam, and says they fit length and waist better than any pants he's owned, as well as being soft outside and great color. I would say that they wear a little baggy, but I guess they are still very comfortable to wear.The dark grey that I purchased has a bit of sheen, so I'd call it more of a gunpowder color. Also the slick texture seems to resist cat hair pretty well (we have 2 cats so this is a big deal in our house).
267, I have mixed feelings about this book. I bought the paperback years ago and burned through the first third of it, thinking how awesome it was. Once into the second third or so, it doesn't take long before the pace dies and you find yourself falling asleep trying to finish it. I set it down.Years later, I thought I'd give it another try only to find that I had given it away, so I picked it up on Kindle. This time I did make it to the end, but wow was it painful. The writing is excellent. The characters are realistic. The science is sound. It.just.moves.soooooo.sloooooooow.
268, although it might be easier to describe all the great bands that this band spawned, this album still shouldn't be ignored. each song is quite long, the majority of which start offf pretty slow and then build slowly to the high point of the song, leaving you either with a hard twist or slowly buiding back down to the original volume level. good vocals, very good lyrics, and sculpted instrumental sounds are the high points of this cd. a great cd to start with if you think you might want to build up to something like tortoise, isotope 217, or godspeed you black emperor, but also a good cd to move back to if you started with some of those bands and would like to hear where so much of it began. it should also be noted that all of slint's albums are pretty different, so even if you didn't really like the other two albums (which is hard to believe), this album would still be well worth a listen.
269, This was a made for TV children's ballet and fairy tale. It combines live action with some animation.  I don't know if American children would be able to follow the story since it was done during the era when much of Russian ballet was done for &#34;propaganda.&#34;The bonus is that the main character is performed by a very young Vladimir Vasiliev.  He's probably one of my favorites of the Russian male dancers and to see him interpret this character at a young age is wonderful.  The few scenes that he shares with Mme. Plisetskaya are endearing.On the whole, after you've watched it once, you'll probably skip through a lot of the political action going on in the kingdom where the story takes place. But, when the ballerina takes center stage, you won't take your eyes off her.
270, This show dates from 1983, and was filmed at Red Rocks in the USA - a natural amphitheatre that provided a memorable backdrop for this, U2's first concert film. The best feature of the performance is the very strong connection U2 evidently makes with its audience. You can feel the energy and intensity in the band's playing, and the strident tone of their War album tracks like New Year's Day and Sunday Bloody Sunday is complemented by effective older tracks like I Will Follow, 11 O'Clock Tick Tock and The Electric Co. This music really did lift U2 to the top of the rock music world , and deservedly so. No one else in 1983 was making such strong guitar-based rock music, and U2 here were still young, charismatic, improving and developing an expanding fanbase. Highly Recommended.
271, Here is my advice for enjoying this book: skip all the Daenerys chapters in the first half of the book. You won't miss much because nothing much happens except (not really a spoiler) she is indecisive about her reign as queen for chapter after chapter after chapter. Once the Tyrion storyline gets to Mereen, start reading the Daenerys chapters, because they pick up a bit. The sections about Jon Snow and the Wall suffer from some of the same lack of forward movement. If you are a fan of the Arya storyline, as I am, you'll be disappointed; there's not much here, though what is here is good. The best storyline is probably Tyrion's (he never disappoints) and the chapters about the Greyjoy siblings and the fate of Winterfell are a pleasant surprise; I found them boring in past books but they are far more interesting this time around.
272, This bathtub was recommended by one of my best friends, a supermom, and I am so glad I bought this on her advice!We've been using this tub since the little girl was a little under a month, and at first I needed to be more supportive of her as she'd squirm and start to slip one way or another.  But already at just 3 months she lays and splashes and plays in the little molding and we can float a duck around at her and clean her so easily as it supports her.  I love that we'll be able to keep using this bath as she grows into this little baby spa.The material is durable, the molding perfect for a little baby and the features are practical.  There is a max fill line and a little drain, though I really just flip it over after we bath her in our tub.  The biggest issue is storage - it would never have fit in our old apartment.  We leave it in the tub, flipped up to dry.
273, I had never heard of this author, and was amazed at the sample, so purchased the first 4.  I didn't know at that point that the series didn't end with 4.  I was so caught up in it, I couldn't stop (not much else got done).  The non-end irritated me severely, but bought book 5, thinking all things would come together.  My first thought at the end was WTF??  Not only did it not end, it didn't get anywhere.  Now, I'm p*ssed at having spent my money on an endless rollercoaster ride, and even worse, I'm bored with it.  I'd like to know how it ends, but by the time the next book comes out, I'm going to have forgotten half the characters and won't care.  I'll save my money & get it from the library.  Maybe.
274, My boyfriend works outdoors (trims/cuts trees under the powerlines in Northern Wisconsin) and it gets quite cold in the winter. He had been wearing good old fashioned long johns when I bought him these for his birthday. They are all he wears now, instead of 2 pairs of long johns. He loves them and I love not having to wash 10 pairs of long johns. I also have a similar pair (women's though) and they are incredible .Not too bulky but very warm in the winter months.
275, When I got my Simmons Changing Pad, this came with it free.  I'm afraid that this is going to get a poopy stain and gross me out to the point that I have to throw it away. It fits the pad great and feels much better to the skin than the plastic cover of the pad.  The terry cloth is so soft and makes the pad so comfy.I was shopping the other day and found that a division of Carter's also makes changing pad covers that will fit the Simmons pad.  They are a little cheaper, but only come in 4 or 5 colors.I read in a review for the Simmons Contoured Changing Pad that the plastic had ripped, so she had to throw it away.  I think that would be a good reason to buy one of these, because you could keep using the pad and just cover up the tear.

277, I love Toto and other 1980s bands. Toto is best known for it's song, Africa and Rosanna. On this compact disc, the songs are unique and different from one another. I like listening to it in the car. I remember them from MTV. Their videos were never memorable but I love the music. Other than Rosanna, the disc includes "Hold the Line," "Georgy Porgy" (funny little song with great sound), I'll Supply the Love, "Goodbye Eleanor," "Africa" (Classic), "Waiting for Your Love," "Stranger In Town," "Holyanna," "Angel Don't Cry," "Til the End," "I'll Be Over You" (one of my favorites), "Without Your Love," "Stop loving You," "Out of Love," and "Can You Hear What I'm Saying?" If you love 80s' music, you will love and remember Toto!
278, This stereo bluetooth device works well but there are corded ear buds and a chain, so you have things hanging all over you when using it.  I needed a stereo bluetooth device because my Verizon XV6800 won't play audio through the bluetooth, except phone calls, with a mono device.  I chose this one because the controls are easy to see and use.  I've had trouble in the past remembering how to use the controls on devices that sit on my ear.  This one is very easy to use, but I don't like the cables that have to link the device to my ears.  I'll probably switch to something that goes around my head sometime in the future.  However, if you don't mind the cables, this device works well.  I use it primarily to listen to recorded books.  When a call comes in, it switches automatically.  Sound quality is great.
279, i'm sure it's been said already many a time, but this is an amazing, underappreciated album...the tracks can stir up so many emotions at once, fear, saddness, hope, congering images both intensely beautiful and horrific...it's sad to see &quot;emo&quot; music today, so much of it was copped off the louisville bands and just diluted...but this is real, this is raw, this is true...finding this cd a few years ago almost single-handedly restored my faith in music again...
280, The film starts out as an" Andromeda Strain" on steroids.  An alien life form that resembles a giant land squid-octopus migrates across "The Infected Zone" of northern Mexico. The locals seemed to have adapted to the monsters , perhaps better than Louisiana has adapted to Hurricanes.Andrew Kaulder (Scoot McNairy) is a US photo journalist who is eager to take pictures of the creatures and the havoc they cause. When a rich man's daughter (Whitney Able) gets trapped in Mexico he is tasked to stop what he is doing and escort her back to the US.The film is rather dull in that it focuses on the couple, their travels, and misadventures.  It doesn't pick up until an hour into the feature.  I found the feature to be over hyped and over rated with an "R".Parental Guide : 1-2 F-bombs, no sex, no nudity. Not much in the violence area either.
281, Phone:Droid XPros:- Great for counting calories- Scans barcodes- Decent repository of food- Can save recipes- Reuse recipes as well as previous meals- Looks good- fast- syncs to website, vice versaCons:- same as in any calorie counter, can spend a lot of time configuring and entering data- Database doesn't contain some popular items, usually theres a close enough option, but i like knowing it's exact.- Wish it automatically kept track of things you enter a lot, in some way, shape, or form. It's exhausting entering everything, and if your meals only change a little, it would be nice to be able to pick and choose from previous entries, more easily.Should you buy?It's free! Website is free as well, what else can you ask for. If you need something that will help you count calories, this is a great option. Out of the few I tried, myfitnesspal is the one I stuck with.
282, I love watching my partner carry our baby in the Baby Bjorn,or "Bjorning the baby" as we call it, because poor Daddy is a real baby fumbler. The Baby Bjorn is simple to use, distributes the weight of baby evenly over both shoulders, and lulls the little one to sleep very easily.  I've seen Dad gain confidence taking charge of the little guy and strut proudly with the little one attatched to his belly. While Baby gets the benefit of being close to Daddy and getting a feel for Daddy's rhythm and hearing Daddy's voice up close, Mommy gets the benefit of a break once in a while! We used it at the State Fair this year and I can't begin to list its benefits over a sroller!  If you're debating between getting this or buying a sling, buy the Bjorn, and custom make your own sling (or find someone who does).  This is the best.
283, What can I say about these gloves. They fit well, look great ( I have the tan set ) I got the idea watching Tony Curtis wear driving gloves in his series &#34; The Persuaders&#34;.  I would never buy anything else. Normally I have a large size but ordered the medium and they ,can I say it, fit like a glove. Only blemish was  a slight stain on the right glove,but was so happy with them,I kept the set and plan on ordering another pair.
284, These 21 music videos in this dvd, are classic 1980's music videos at their best. Annie Lennox is not only beautiful, but she is an excellent lead vocalist. The portrayal of these music videos are awesome. Annie is fantastic. I love all of them, but some of my favorites include: "Sweet Dreams", "Here Comes the Rain Again", "There Must Be an Angel", "Sisters are doing it for Themselves" (with Aretha Franklin), and "Missionary Man". These videos are just as good now, as they were back in the 1980's. Thanks!!!!
285, This is my favorite Clancy book - and edging out the Hunt for Red October isn't easy.  This is a thick book, yet you will get through it quickly because it is so interesting.  It has the most character development of any book.  Rainbox 6 follows this, so you should read Without Remorse before Rainbow 6.  Note, there are fairly descriptive scenes - torturing a man with a pressure tank, young women forced into rough sex (pliers on parts of the body, etc.).  But without villians you can't have a hero.
286, I just received this for my birthday and I love it!  The color is great: very feminine but not 'fru-fru'.  It's so light-weight and comfortable.  I'm not too concerned about durability because I'm not hard on things.  But if it ever starts 'falling apart' I will be sure to update my review.  Two months later I still love this watch - light-weight and comfortable - wear it day and night but remove it to take a shower.  Overall a great value.
287, First of all, you MUST be sure that you're wanting a push-up bra when you order this guy.  It's SUPER nice, but the straps are a bit thin on it and I'm thinking that unlike other Playtex products, it won't last as long as the rest of them do.  That said, you might want to go up a little in size.  The cups were a bit small, like Victoria's Secret's items.  Quality is much higher than Victoria's, but well, the sizing is almost the same.  I'm having to send mine back to get another size, which is larger than what I normally wear in Playtex's items.  SO love these bras!  They wash and wear nicely too, just keeping my sewing machine close by just in case on this one. Highly recommend!
288, I love this app in theory and it is adorable.I have it on my Mytouch 4G, and it uses the front facing camera by default.  However,  the pictures show up as nothing but streaks of color or black and grey.  When I use the rear camera this doesn't happen.I like the app but would love to be able to use the front facing camera and have the pictures come out right!I also contacted customer service a week ago,  and after an initial response asking what version of Android I had,  I have not heard back.
289, Stevie Wonder is still a ways away from his 70's breakout sound but he's getting alot closer.His heavy use of the clavinetand funky material like &quot;You Can't Judge A Book By It's Cover&quot;and a cover of The Beatles &quot;We Can Work It Out&quot; get the ball rolling.He still serves up the classic title hit as well assome interesing tunes like &quot;I Can't Let My Heaven Walk Away&quot;.But as with all period Motown releaes it has it's padding-marked by formless filler material between the singles.But thatwould change in the next couple years!
290, These little bottles are surprisingly strong and light weight for what they are, which is a glass bottle.  While they can shatter, it takes a lot to get them there thanks to their compact build.  On top of that, you don't need to worry about BPA.The only problem with these bottles is that they have to be screwed down just right to allow airflow into the bottle and prevent baby from gulping air.  This can be solved with a nipple that Gerber puts out made of brown silicone that has a cross cut in the side of the nipple.  It's absolutely perfect for these little bottles.
291, When I think of 80s funk one name comes to the top of the list, Rick James-- the master of funk. This is the quintessential Rick James album. Every single song just vibrates with the type of groove that has not been able to be duplicated since this album arrived. It's a true classic in every aspect of that word and anyone who is interested in music history and albums that have made an impact need this in their collection.This is a master song writer at the top of his game and he does so with such a stroke of genesis it's easy to guess that he didn't even realize at the time how great this actually was because he was making the music from the purity of his soul. And it shows.There will never be another album like this one.Street Songs is the ultimate funk and soul record of popular culture from the 80s.It will blow your mind and your speakers!
292, I was going to watch a television show but I had some time before it started so I got my kindle and found this app and started playing.  What I thought would be ten minutes turned out to be my whole movie and I turned out being some sort of whiz at it as I got on some kind of top performer list.  That is not what they call it but I can't think of the correct name but I am number six on the list of people playing!  Give it a try!
293, and I mean it. It is the second time I read the book since it was released it. The first time I couldn't turn it down, so gripping it was, but then I did miss a lot. This time I used time, and really, it was worthwhile. I think that whoever like good science fiction and have some concern for life and what sustain it, should read it. I am waiting to read the second book, as I remember I liked even more, but I don't remember why. It will be fun to find out.
294, This was such an upgrade from our last bath tub, my daughter is 5 months old and on the big side for height and weight. This tub is so large but in a good way. I'd just like to forewarn you do not need to put too much water into this tub since they are reclined so deeply into, and the only con is there isnt any grips on it so once your kid finds out how much fun it is in this tub they can jump around and thus slip around a bit- not bad-- but wanna keep a close eye on them.
295, Good turban for wet hair! My other turban is getting old and I can't find that one anymore so thought this would be close to the old towel. It is small so better for people with a smaller head size and not a lot of long thick hair. I have small head and shorter thin hair and it is a bit snug for me, the elastic is snug. Seems like a good product it does absorb a lot if water because when I take it off the ycloth seems a lot wetter then my other regular towel turban. I like the button and loop feature stays in place real well.i I just hope after time the elastic loosens a bit.I haven't washed yet, need to remember do not use bleach or fabric softner on these.
296, Hmm I ordered this and received it within three to four days i don't remember.. But anyways, I have been using this product for a week now and haven't seen no changes.. my nails are a little stronger but no different then they were before.. I use to bite my nails like crazy when I was in middle school, but now I'm 20 I don't bite them as often they're just short.. I hope I see progress soon or I'm going to be upset.. that this product was all hype smh..*Update on March 20,2013*I'm going to change my ratings on this to 4 stars because I've been using this product for over a month now, and people have been saying my nails look like they are french tipped! My nails are very strong and if they break it's just a little bit. But I do notice, as soon as remove the nail polish after a day one of my nails break or get real soft. So we'll see what happens...
297, This is not a typical fantasy story, it's a never ending series of well-described events involving perfectly profiled characters in a wonderful setting.It's hard to grasp, you usually forget half of what you read and to be honest it doesn't matter.  You could skip 100 pages and keep on reading as if nothing.It's like life.  Not everything happens for a reason, the sequence of events is unpredictable, follows no moralistic or predictable model and you can either hate it or get used to it.  I decided to be the latter.
298, I bought this for my morphine juice pack, lost the adapter that came with. I turned out this fit better than my original one. But lacks in sound quality a little not by much like when you listen to some Bluetooth speaker. Seems little tight on female end, but no big deal. Make sure not to focus when you insert/pull. So far works well with iPhone earbud, beats studio, and my Audio Technica. Oh yeah delay respond on attached remote on both apple earbud and beat studio...\
299, This is quite an extraordinary album. Ok it is from the Fall period where Brix Smith ctually helped to clean up ther otherwise  muddy sound but this is on all accounts not really easy listening. This is what really was aletrenative music back in the day; the kind of record you were almost scared to go in and buy. From its creepy cover to its hard music it had all the elements of must be considered some of the best post-punk music around. It manages to mix an industrial sound with pop hooks in a  very unique way, while also haveing Mark E Smith's rants. They would do some better albums later on but this is really when and where they cleaned up their sound. Unique.
300, Recently my allergies have been out of control, and with my symptoms it has meant that I've been itchy... all over.  Even my scalp has been itchy. So I decided to change shampoos. In particular, I was looking for a shampoo that was free of scent of unnecessary chemicals.Looking through all of Amazon's offerings my eye landed on DHS Clear Shampoo and the good ratings other customers had given it. And after dithering and consideration I went ahead and made my purchase.I'm pretty happy. I've have used it twice now and while I'm still not entirely itch free elsewhere my scalp is no longer irritated.  I credit the lack of perfumes and colorants and other chemical for my present state of happiness.Definitely recommend you try this if you have an irritated scalp. I saw definitely improvement after the second shampoo.  I'll come back and modify the review after I see how it effects my long hair --dries it out or not.
301, Like so many programs out there today, the food database makes little or no sense. Foods are always based on volume even when they should be based on weight. Entering values that can be easily adjusted for later use is a pain (e.g. entering 10 grams and wanting 11 grams the next time because it assumes you are entering a &#34;portion&#34; size). Creating recipes is not bad -- editing them is terrible unless you are on the PC. Basically, the PC version is OK, but the tablet version LEAVES a lot to be desired.
302, As the previous review stated, this is the perfect tub for a tall baby. Our 24 in tall 2 month old outgrew her 4Moms CleanWater tub and we wanted to find a tub she can continue to use as she grows. She loves this tub as she can kick her feet around with plenty of room. It seems to be made well and is super sturdy, we have been using it for a month and I can see using it until she grows out of it. Yes, it is big but we keep it in the bathtub of our spare bathroom all the time so it is not an issue. If you only have one bathroom and are low on storage space, you would probably want to look elsewhere but if you have the space, this is a must!
303, The prongs on this comb are cheap machine made plastic that is actually too sharp and scratchy to the touch to put through hair. Always test a new comb on your hand, and if it scratches your hand then it will cut at your hair strands damaging them. If you have short hair this would be fine because the sharpness is high up in the comb, but for mid back length heavy hair these teeth will absolutely ravage your hair. Sometimes you truly do get what you pay for so I suggest the wenn shower comb instead - it's excellent for thick or fine hair alike and it's extremely well made.
304, The arguably offensive title aside, this is one of my favorite Flashman books, out the twelve that George MacDonald Fraser was able to write. One reason may be the fact that it's set in America, but I suspect that more pertinent to my liking the novel is the resonance between its two halves. In the first, Flashman joins a party journeying westward in 1849. In the second, he is present at the 1876 Battle of the Little Bighorn, where he meets his past once more. As always this this series, the story-telling is gripping, the prose transparent and flowing, and the historical research impeccable -- the pieces once more fit together with inevitable, easy coincidence. Fraser certainly knew how to relate a tale, and this is one of the best he ever constructed.
305, 'Sign O' The Times' is the most accomplished album Price evermade and he's made some classics.And this extremely well filmedconcert movie strings togther pure live footage and performancesexcerpted for his MTV videos of the period.The live version of&quot;Forever In  My Life&quot; (one of my top ten favorite Prince songs)kicks the PANTS off the album version.But Prince-what is thebuisness about squirrel meat?And IS life nothin' but a muffin?Sometimes this guys conversation baffles me but you just can'tfault his sublime musical taste.He's a bit Chuck Berry,Hendrix,Santana and even Liberace (in dress sometimes,anyway) all rolledinto one unique musical ball.A sheer delight all through!
306, This is like getting 4 separate Battery Tenders, except they're all in the same housing. It's about the same price as 3 stand along single chargers but doesn't take up as much space or need multiple outlets to plug into. It's very convenient if you have up to 4 batteries you need to keep in top shape. If you're not familiar with Battery Tender then check around. This charger is the standard for maintaining 12v lead acid batteries in cars, boats, motorcycles, generators etc.I really only have 2 minor complaints about this, which is why I took off 1 star:1) it has a plastic body, unlike their single/stand alone chargers. The metal housing on the single charger seems more durable but the plastic is ok.2) the leads are not long enough so I had to purchase the additional 25' extensions. I wish they were included with the multi-chanel chargers.
307, Stan Robinson does an outstanding job of tackling one of the most talked about and inspirational next steps in the human spaceflight program. About the only thing missing is Burt Rutan and his SpaceShipOne.Character development is realistic and very detailed. You feel yourself living the lives of these characters as they embark on an amazing journey that provides discoveries not just about Mars, but about humankind itself.The technical aspects of the book are second to none. In this respect the Mars Trilogy would stand up to the most serious critics. It could be future history itself - it's that good.It is an outstanding book (and Trilogy) and comes with the highest recommendation.
308, This is a big improvement over our previous tub, which had no built-in supports - only a separate chair on which our son would constantly be sliding downward.Three places for improvement:1. There is no stand, and apparently you can't purchase one.  I built my own to elevate the tub 6&#34;-7&#34; in order to save my back.  (I don't endorse this - a poorly built stand would present its own obvious risks).  Plus I feel safer being able to reach the baby easier.2. It doesn't drain fully on its own - it must be tipped later on after the baby is out.3. The middle support piece could be taller.  For the most part, it holds my 6-month-old in the reclining position.  However, the does a full-body kick (like in professional wrestling to escape a pin), and has almost managed to throw his whole body onto the top of the supporting piece.
309, Another reviewer noted a scene that was cut due to content, I wouldn't have remembered it if they hadn't told me:( But other than that the picture looks as good as it possibly can, only a few times does it show it's age. Overall this is an interesting video, with lots of great performances, some videos and humor thrown in. If you like Michael Jackson this is a must have, if you are a fan of 80s music/videos you would definitely be pleased as well.
310, Paired flawlessly with my Chocolate.  Have used it almost 30 feet away from the phone without losing connection!  The earbud covers - you get two different ones (one set of one, two of the other.)  The traditional, round, style have better sound but fill with sweat when working out. Literally fill - have to drain them every 15 minutes or so. The open style does not have this problem, but has poorer sound quality and lets in more ambient noise.Yes, you can only hear the phone calls in the left ear, but that's the communication's standard.  If your phone transmitted it in stereo, it would play in stereo.Basically, make sure you know the phone/mp3 player/whatever the device is standard.  Don't blame the car if you buy the wrong seat covers. Don't blame the headset if you purchase it for the wrong device!It supports all current bluetooth standards. Does your device?
311, Tina Turner is a woman with a fire in her stomach know one can put out, she knows what she wants, and she sticks to her "guns" to get it. At 50-years-old to a crowd of 70,000 screaming fans in Barcelona,Spain Tina knew what she wanted from the crowd and with a wonderful band, beautifully choreagraphed dances, beautiful dancers, a suspened crane that goes a 100 feet into the crowd, a large metal 30-foot-staircase, and tons of pyrotechnics and fireworks she got it."Typical Male" was the best song she performed in this concert. Tina Turner is a woman who is loved by millions of people. If you don't own this video and you are Tina fan, you are missing out.
312, I got into rap seriously back in the days of Warren, Dre, Snoop, &amp; Pac. Regulate was really tight. Doggystyle was bumping everywhere you went...But this CD was it for me. This CD took me from uncertainty about rap to being a firm believer that given the right rapper, anybody can love rap. It's been about 4 years now and I still play this CD and absolutely love it. Songs for when you feel good, bad, mad, sad, whatever. 2 discs of tracks you're always willing to hear. This is what all rap should be like. Forget Jay-Z, No Limit, Cash Money. This was the REAL thug. This was the REAL rap. Pac put his heart in it like no other. If you don't get into this album, you don't know what rap actually is.
313, Bought this just over a year ago and the strap is falling apart :o(  I wear my watches daily and do a lot of physical activity so I need them to be able to take a lot of abuse.....this one did not perform well at all.  The color fades to a yucky tarnished brown color....pretty for a few months and then....well yuck!  Since you can't change out the strap this thing is a terrible waste of money.....now I have to buy a new watch and it won't be one with this type of strap.  The strap has a wider end to it and it keeps catching on everything!  Oh and did I mention that the strap has stretched and stretched.....I was using it on hole #3 and now it's on #5 and still stretching......just NOT a good buy.
314, This is awesome.  Every time i go to empty the poop tank I get to see everything!  Corn, peanuts, lettuce, seriously...everything!Ok, now that the poop humor is done, It really does help.  When you have a clog, you can see that it's clogged and not just assume that you have an empty tank.  It also helps if you're like me and you want your tank clean, like clear water coming out of the black tank clean.  You can ensure that you get the clean flush every time.
315, When buying a new car, they always fill the fluid tank with the regular blue washer fluid. I can either extract all of that fluid and replace with Rain-X fluid, or use the additive. I found the additive to be similar to the Rain-X treatment, but possibly more concentrated. I poured 4 oz into my fluid tank, and it worked. Water droplets tend to sheet away at speeds above 45 mph. Is it better than the full treatment? Of course not, but I found that using just the Rain-X wiper fluid was sufficient, and this additive is only going to be used until I consume the original fluid. After that, I would start using the orange Rain-X wiper fluid year-round.I didn't have any issues with streaking, water marks, or anything negative. This additive works.Overall: 5/5 stars
316, The Beatles came together in 1962.  They toured England, had three number one hits, and were a big success.  On February 7, 1964, they landed at Kennedy International Airport in New York.  Two days later they would be seen by 73,000,000 Americans on the Ed Sullivan Show.  This DVD shows that time period through an hour and a half of historic black and white footage.  Featured here are four songs from that landmark Sullivan appearance, plus two others.  Also there are three songs from their Washington, DC concert, their first American gig.  In between concert footage, this documentary shows the Beatles behind the scenes.  All in all a splendid effort.  Any Beatles fan will treasure this documentary as a beautiful piece of history.
317, I was thrilled to find I could finally replace all my vinyl 12" singles on 1 CD...but, not exactly ALL! There was a 12" version of "Say You Say Me" (one of the biggest singles on this disc), that ran only 30 seconds longer than the album version, and my guess would be that it's actually the ORIGINAL length Lionel recorded, but was perhaps cut down for the original vinyl LP release. Wish it had been put on here instead of the 4 minute version, because I can't see it ever seeing the light of day on CD anywhere else.
318, I like the size of this battery.  It is easily pocket-able and feels sturdy enough to withstand the occasional drop.  The flashlight is a nice touch but it would be nice to see a dedicated switch for the flashlight.  The surface of the battery is very close to a matte black finish that helps with not showing fingerprints.  The battery seems to charge my iPhone without any issues.  It's nice that New Trent has included a charging cable with the device so you can just use your iPhone wall charger or PC for charging.
319, Just really great Feedback from my buddy who received this Ironman watch for his BD gift, from me..I picked this watch, because of it's unique features, ratings and the fact that it first caught my eye, when I saw it featured in a movie. In the movie, it was worn by Will Ferrell, in 'Stranger Than Fiction'.Feedback is:* Stainless Steel bracelet > Solid feeling!* Functions in Dual Mode, LED + Sweep Hands* Large number digits, easy to see* Silent Blue Glow Light alarm, Extra Cool!* H2O proof* May be worn as a dress timepiece
320, Like Zappa's music not even going to TRY to explain this movie.Zappa may have never used drugs but this movie plays like one long hallucination.Ringo Starr dresses like Zappa,Flow and Eddie wonder around and sometimes they band play songs.Cartoons and sketches that have nothing to do with the film come and go with unpredictable regularlity and sometimes there's psychedelic imagry that doesn't seem to need to be there.And Frank Zappa doesn't do much himself-I don't think he even speaks in the movie.For his five minutes or so I find keyboardist George Duke the funniest-he and Flow and Eddie should have done their own films becuase they're the heart of '200 Motels'.For a visual treat I highly recommend this film,if you can find it.For those looking for a film with a graspable plot and meaning your in the wrong neigborhood.
321, Don't know what other reviewers are seeing. I opened the package, cleaned the iphone surface with a moist paper towel first, then with a dry napkin (my simple way of cleaning the surface), then cleaned with the cleaning cloth supplied (it all took less than a minute), and applied the screen protector. It went on cleanly with very little bubbles that I could remove with the supplied applicator (a small plastic tool to remove the bubbles).BargainCell promptly shipped them on ordering and I got it in 3 days. More than a week now and so far the screen is holding up well.Update: Two months later and it is still ok - no bubbles and it is sticking to the surface correctly. Great product for a very good price (even the high cost of shipping is worth it), compared to similar products being sold in Fry's for $10 or more.
322, I bought a bottle for my daughter (10) and myself to help us to stop bitting out nails.  The flavor to me is bitter, but not a digusting flavor.  It stays on the tongue for apx 10min.  For me, it did help me to stop bitting my nails bc the taste would remind me to get my fingers out of my mouth.For my daughter, she doesn't use it everyday, so it hasn't helped her.....if she used it everyday, I'm sure that it would keep her from biting her nails.  The problem is it has to be applied daily to get that bitter taste effect & she doesn't remember to apply it daily, or just doesn't want to.I do think that the price, $12.00 a bottle ,is a little over priced.
323, I needed this shirt for a project, and the deadline is fast approaching.  Was supposed to be 50/50 cotton/poly blend, pre-shrunk, so I ordered the size appropriately.  Turned out to be 100% cotton, which, of course, shrunk in the wash.  It's too inexpensive to be worth mailing back for a refund, so I'm out a few dollars. Believe the other bad reviews... this is a total bait and switch.Retailer was NY Lingerie, fulfilled by Amazon.Edit:  Amazon has offered a refund, given me a free return shipping to print, and help in waiving shipping fees for an alternative shirt.  As always, Amazon is awesome when they get a complaint.  It seems a lot of comparable shirts on Amazon have complaints of bad QC, sizing, or other issues, so I'm just going to try and get something locally instead.
324, The best part of this monitor is the price. You really can't beat it. You can tell in the quality of the construction. They're very light cheap plastic. But I don't think that really matters as long as it works. I had originally bought one and it worked very well. It was crystal clear so I was impressed for the money I had spent. I then made the mistake of buying a second monitor for my second child's room when my old monitor conked out. Unfortunately even putting each one on separate channels (there are 2 to pick from) the reception became terrible. I could hear each bedroom from each monitor along with screeching static. I ended up having to shelve the second monitor and get a more expensive unit. If you only need one it will probably work great for you. However if you need two, save your money and get a better unit with more channels.
325, This is an extraordinarily enjoyable spectacle, a true feast for the senses. First  of all, the sets and costumes are beautifully formed and colored. Then, the music by Prokofiev is perfect, exquisiely toned to evoke love, excitement, sorrow; it's as excellent as the play or the ballet. And the protagonists are perfectly cast, with an added poignancy coming from what one knows of their tragic personal lives, doomed lovers indeed: Nureyev dying from AIDS, Fonteyn descending into poverty and loneliness (see Tony Palmer's excellent bio), David Blair (the perfect Mercutio) dying suddenly at 43.There are many truly memorable moments: the formal stepping out of the males and then the females at the grand ball, the High Renaissance itself; the duel between Tybalt and Mercutio, and the latter's dying moments; the exuberant mass dances in the marketplace. I especially liked the three harlots for their devil-may-care elan..
326, Boy did I need this!  I am a new bike owner and I had no idea what a "tender" was.  I was encouraged to get one by the guy who sold me the bike.  This is a very valuable investment.  The bike had a brand new battery when I bought it (less than 2 weeks old); however, it has been too cold to ride it regularly.  Of course the battery was about dead on a warm day in February and I wasn't able to ride it.  I keep it on the tender now and I can ride any time I get ready...it works great!
327, I do my own valves on the car. I had my heart set on an off-set type of gauge, but the dummies out there have their sizes starting off at .008. You blew it, guys. There are zillions of us out here who need that .006. Anyway, this is a nice quality basic set. Five stars: there's the little hand tight nut on the side, so you can open the whole thing and remove the ones you don't want -- to make it your custom set -- or just take the individual ones out that you want and use them loose. I like it. Another bull's eye by Amazon -- a quality tool and a bargain at that.
328, Wow!  I have tried other brands with the flavor trigger to induce vomiting if fingers are put into mouth.  Kidding about vomiting, but the taste seriously lingers for a long time.  It's nasty.  My brain would automatically stop me when I started to nibble.  Usually, when I'm editing my writing on the computer.  Now I will need to purchase a nail hardening system since I can finally see the whites of my nails.  I was never a nail biter until I started this insidious habit 2 years ago.  Before too long, my beautiful, healthy and much longer nails were being nibbled to the quick.  I suggest anyone try it if they just can't stop biting on their own.  Or, for those kids who are too old for thumb sucking.  Wished I known about this while my daughter was growing up.  She actually sucked her thumb through the 4th grade.  Nothing we tried would get her to stop.  Even wearing gloves at night!
329, 3 1/2The fearless instrumental group of experimental math-rockers blazed a small but distinct trail across this subgenre, layering drumkit assaults after angular riffs in a more intimidating way then most of their peers could ever imagine. Even early on, when the group often felt more controlled experiment then experimental control, a rhythmic complexity, anchored by an amazing, ever-questing drummer, never eludes the at-times fascinating interplay. The last few tracks helped rein in these overwhelmingly spastic hardcore jam sessions with a little more melodic development, hinting at further greatness to come.
330, I bought all this soap when I bought an infrared sauna.  The medical labs recommend that you use a glycerin soap like this or Black soap to clean the toxic waste off your skin that sweat brings to the surface.  I used this soap when I was a teen and remembered its scent--which I like.  The soap is a bit drying so I have to moisturize with pure almond oil afterwards.  I did find raw Black African soap from Ghana that I like better--no petrol or chemicals in it.  And, it does not dry like this soap does.  I bought it from a site on Amazon and frankly, I like the Black soap the best.  Four stars because it dries the skin--but if you are very oily you might need that!
331, Great concept. I love being able to access from the web and my kindle. I've used the app for about a week now.  I enjoy being able to track both my food and exercise. The database is huge. If l look close enough I have been able to either find a correct entry or build a recipe.I only give 4 stars because- foods are very clumsy and hard to manage- database is over populated with bad data- searches could be tuned to my usage- searches could be fuzzy to correct for different spellingsI recommend this app.
332, Acceptable adventure film of the sword and sandals genre, set in Roman Britain, has some Roman soldiers, survivors from a massacre against the bloody Pict tribes, fleeing behind enemy lines. Historically dubious (the ragtag platoon includes, seemingly for PC reasons and ludicrously from a historical point of view, a black roman soldier), this violent and bloody, muscular and masculine film is, for all its flaws, certainly entertaining. I found this better and more enjoyable than the recent, similarly themed Eagle of the Ninth. The pristine, misty Scottish outdoors where this movie was filmed certainly helps. Acting is not the main point of this movie, as the actors have to put up with some terse, rough lines. Michael Fassbender, who was fine in the more recent X-Men film, fails to make much of an impression here as the top Roman soldier here, but Ukrainian model Olga Kurylenko, is surprisingly OK as the top warrioress of the Picts.
333, I bought the LP of this a few days ago, It's really good.  It's not &quot;Songs on the key of life&quot;, but if you are a person that likes Stevie's eariler work, this is for you (if you ever bought the LP  &quot;Looking Back&quot;, the three record set and liked it, you should get  this.)  Everything that Stevie has done is great, this album is no  exception.  I only have the LP, so I don't know if the CD version is messed  up, but Motown is pretty good about re-releasing things.
334, The shoe runs narrow.  The inside label says both &#34;B&#34; and &#34;D&#34;, B is printed on top of a line and D is printed underneath.  I don't know what that means, I ordered D width, but they seem to be a B width by appearance.  HOWEVER, they are very comfortable anyway on my wide feet!  They are well-made and quite attractive, I can wear them with nice dresses/skirts.  I am going to order more.
335, I absolutely despise the thin scraggly cords that come with corded headphones and earphones. I always catch them on something and that yanks the phones off my ears. So, I bought these for my iPod Touch on sale at a big box electronics retailer about 3 years ago.The sound quality on these phones is crystal clear. Background "hiss" is almost undetectable at normal listening levels. Sibilance is spot-on, and voices are loud and clear. It is lacking a little in the bass frequencies, but that to me is an acceptable tradeoff for not having the cord.Battery life after all this time is excellent, and with occasional use I only have to charge it once a month or so.The set is also a hands-free device for your cell phone, and people I have called with it say they have no problem hearing me. I hear them just fine.This is a great value in lower-end bluetooth headsets!
336, The IMP 500 by IMAX Power is the best protable battery you can buy.  I got one and it malfunctioned and the company quickly shipped me a replacement.  The customer support and service is top notch. I would not hesitate to buy anything from them.  The battery charges my Motorola Droid in about 1.5 hours.  Unbelievable. The IMP 500 still has hours of charges left after charging my Droid and iPod Touch.  It is so easy to use and looks great too.  Compact and easy to carry. The cable and the connectors are excellent too. If you need a portable battery, this is the one to buy.
337, I'm making this brief, though it may come across as a current suggestion, but given the context and heat of the King of Pop's death, one would expect somebody to finally release this long lost gem stuck in the analogue world to be re-seen in its respective quality as of 2009/2010 on blu-ray or hell just DVD in general. My waiting begins now.And like everyone else, i saw it for the first time back in 1989 or so when i was little, and i had the vinyl for MJ's Bad album, so i was highly into him back then and mesmerized.I recommend buying his album Bad first, then watching this film for the full effect that we all had gotten back in the 80's.
338, Good fit, although I took others suggestions about the length and they were dead on. If you typically wear a 32 in the length get a 30" and you'll be good. I found the waist to be true to size. The pants are comfortable, maybe a touch lightweight for the winter but I get cold easier than most. Otherwise very comfortable, they have pleanty of room in legs and the rise is roomy. All in all they look nice and I love the cargo pockets. I would reccomend these to anyone
339, A rich heiress ( Gemma Atherton) is kidnapped by two ex-convicts and a ransom demand of 2 million pounds is made. Most of the plot, if revealed, will lead you think' Haven't I seen this movie' but leave these assumptions aside as this movie is a twister with turns happening at every interval and the balance of power shifting between the kidnapper and the kidnapped. This is a very difficult movie to review because writing about the plot would give a lot away. Still, it is a treat to watch. Three stars. 2/3/11
340, These earrings are cute, and appropriate for the price the seller is charging.  I agree with someone who posted earlier that the flat back of the earrings sometimes shows (particularly true if you have short hair).  The good news is that the backs of the earrings aren't ugly or anything.  Just flat and not pretty.  I, too, wish the earrings had been designed more solidly (and more three-dimensional), but for this price, what can you expect?  They are pretty, and they are a nice length.  They are a little delicate, but not really fragile.
341, The BlackBerry Curve 8310 from AT&T has served us very well. Its feature-set and quality are superb. The keys are a bit small, but that is easy to live with. The screen is bright and colorful. The rollerball takes a little getting used to and should be cleaned at certain intervals, but we like it better than the side dial. The red is a great shade and makes the phone a little more attractive for those who care. There are plenty of applications for the BlackBerry, and for what it is meant to do, it does it with ease. Call quality is great. Push e-mail is what BlackBerry does best. Text messaging is simple. BB chat is nice if you know others with BlackBerries. We are not huge fans of the media player, but that is just a matter of taste. Make sure you get memory chip for extra storage.
342, Product arrived on-time from amazon. Purchased this for an old motorcycle that I was tired of swapping chargers with.  I opted to give this one a try because of all the positive reviews.  This charger is just a poorly made product.  Even though is was $20, and less than other brands I have purchased, I think it is a waste of money. First, it says it is for agm batteries, but only charges a battery at 14.3v.  Agm's need a higher voltage than this (in fact all batteries need a higher voltage than this). Second, it would not bring my battery up to a full charge. Lastly, the charger runs really hot, so I was afraid to leave this connected for a long period of time. Frustrated, I decided to open up the charger, and to my surprise, all there is is a transformer and a diode.  For a transformer in a box, I should have paid a lot less.
343, I use to purchase Docker's all the time because of the quality, recent purchases of Docker pants have shown that the company is greedy, charging a high price for a poor quality item.  I decided to make a switch and try some IZOD pants.These pants fit perfect for me, the quality of the material is what Dockers used to be and at a much lower cost to me.A three way win.No more button popping, no more inaccurate lengths in their sizing chart (Dockers), no more thin easy rip issues.
344, I am a self starter, and this app is perfect for me. It is a "poor man's weight watchers" type program in that it helps you develop weight loss/maintenance goals and tracks calorie intake and burn in order to attain those goals. The food and exercise database is extensive. Entry is simple, and becomes even easier as you use it more since the app creates you personal database.  If you need a support system, you can (which I don't) develop a network of others also trying to manage their weight and fitness through the forum and blog.
345, It feels biased in my opinion toward the house. I say this because I counted the amount of times I was within 4 of 21 and the computer came out ahead of me 9 out of 10 times. Ahead by 1 point each time. The computer also seemed to have a much lower chance at drawing high value cards, allowing it to keep pushing until it was 1 ahead.In the free version you get a limited number of coins, which I kind of like. It adds some requirement and benefit to winning for me and it gives you more for playing and for ranking up. The program doesn't close though, you just go back to home menu which irritates me.
346, This film captures one of rock's most creative bands at their absolute creative peak. They were still wildly experimental, just on the cusp of mega-stardom. The film captures the Floyd just before Roger Waters began  dominating the group and terrorizing the shyer members of the band, such as  Rick Wright. The film is a perfect visual representation of the Floyd in  this period--conceptual, strange, trippy though tasteful. Their interviews  in the film are priceless, especially Nick Mason's bitter struggle to get a  slice of pie without the crust. The film demands multiple viewings.
347, I could give you a long review full of performance enhancement claims, but I'll just be blunt. Ever since I switched to K&N, my used oil seems less dirty when I drain it and having the 1" nut welded to the top of the filter makes changing it a breeze. If you own a car with a hard to reach filter, that nut alone will make it worth every penny of the filter's cost. I have a Toyota Camry where I can barely even get my hand back to the filter through the tiny opening, let alone get enough leverage to loosen it by hand or use a conventional filter wrench. Not an issue with this filter. 1" socket on a ratchet with an extension shaft and it comes right off in just a few seconds.
348, After purchasing the depot, I found it does not work well on my changing table (dresser style with fold out top). I had to put it on the side and was not pleased to find out that it is not possible to use unless it is hung. More bad news... I purchased the Ultimate Wipes Warmer, which will not fit on top of the depot while it is hanging on the side of the changing table. Perhaps these products work fine with a typical changing table, but keep in mind they do not work with a folding top dresser type.
349, Tried out thigh high -- and now prefer them to panty hose -- comfortable, and they stay up.  Was concerned they might &#34;slide down&#34; as the day progressed -- but well-made band keeps them in place without and pinching....don't notice the band after  putting them on.Like the ability to only have to throw away &#34;one&#34; of the pair if you get a run....and can easily mix with other packages of same color as color quality consistent.At first, was concerned about price (more costly than panty hose) -- but fit, feel, and durability make up for this.  Would recommend product, quality, style, and vendor.
350, I've always just bought an international phone card when I've traveled but decided to take my own phone this one time and try one of these sim cards. Well, let me tell you. I made about 45 minuets of calls during a total of 3 weeks and my overall bill was $176. So, if you do the math, I could have spend about $13 American dollars on a 10 euro calling card with 400 minuets and called from the hotel or any public phone....or $176 for less than an hour of calls. This was certainly the worse choice I made for my trip and I advise you to NOT buy this! Amazon.com, please consider taking this off your list of products...it is very misleading and cost consumers way too much money after it is purchased.
351, Do you believe in magic? Well, if you don't, try Rezamid and it will make a believer out of you. I'm always amazed at how quickly Rezamid works on my acne. I put it on at night, and notice a reduction in redness and the size of blemishes by morning. I've found that it works better if I tap it on with the tip of my finger, but don't spread it. It ends up being a little blobby, but that doesn't matter when I'm sleeping. If I have a particularly bad breakout, I'll use it during the day, but that usually isn't necessary because it works so quickly at night. It is a bit expensive, but you don't need a lot to make a difference, so this little bottle will last a long time. I've used other products, but none of them work as well as this does.
352, What makes this book a treat is all the technical information that goes into it. I'm not a soldier, weapons expert, or engineer, so I found the plethora of information a bit overwhelming, but I did come away having learned a few new things. The fact that this book is so well-researched gives a solidity to the novel that utilizes this information to tell us what is going on and what is being used. This was my first Tom Clancy book, and I was not disappointed at all. This tale of revenge and the man who metes it out rather meticulously - can't help but admire Tom Clancy for detail - made for a very enjoyable read. I do feel that the ending was just a bit cheesy (I shan't spoil it for you) but it was overall solid and satisfying. Two thumbs up!
353, My case is extremely dry, sensitive, and has multiple allergies.  I have a terrible time finding body care products that work well without irritating my skin.  Neutrogena comes through again!  This oil smells great (light but pleasant) and has a very light texture.  It does not feel greasy at all.  It absorbs within a minute or two.  I haven't had any "oil stains" on clothes or sheets like I used to get when I used pure coconut oil.  I have never found any other oil or lotion that moisturizes better.  As a side note, if you have keratosis pilaris (those little red chicken skin bumps on your arms or thighs) this is a miracle worker!  Within a few weeks, my skin looks dramatically better.
354, Easy to set up and connects easily and automatically to my cell phone (Samsung Galaxy S4). I haven't tried using multiple cell lines. I love that the land-line phone rings like a regular land line, and I love that I can dial out with an antique rotary phone. It's like it's 1950 again at my desk. But the audio quality is substandard, which seems to be a real issue with Bluetooth; I've had many Bluetooth headsets and almost all of them have bad audio. How difficult can it be, when phone audio is so limited in the bandwidth it needs? It's not like 7-channel movie audio or something. The audio improves after the first few seconds of the call, for whatever reason, and people at the other end sometimes comment on the &#34;bad connection&#34; and sometimes don't. So maybe it's like 1950 again in terms of the audio quality too.
355, I was pleasantly surprised by this series.  At first I thought it would be yet another variation on roguish cop investigates homocides - which it is.  But the pleasant surprise was the great character development of the main character.  Obviously the writing and acting are good to carry off another rendition of this basic story format but it's the humor that sets it apart.  It's a bit quirky yet plausible.  The main character is played to perfection: confident but not really arrogant - just confident.  He doesn't look like a cop so much which isn't anything new, but he's more like an updated Sherlock Holmes without being condescending, annoying or any of the arrogance.  He's brilliant and yet could be a pro poker player...very entertaining!
356, A truly up-to-date mystery.  This was a well wrapped mystery that pulled me deeper into the politics and corporate dishonesty.  I liked the fact that I could identify the good guys fairly early on but still question who was trustworthy.  To watch the unraveling built the tension and kept the story interesting.  I wanted to watch the next segment to uncover more of the truth.  This is a great mystery and even at the end, I felt like I had answers but still had questions.
357, It reads like one of the weakest books in the WoT series.  So much useless detail that does not move the plot forward.  Remember when you had a paper that was due in two weeks and you tried and tried to write something and couldn't come up with anything.  But you put in enough filler that if changed the spacing to 1.5 and picked a different font you would get your minimum 10 pages, 8 of which was just restating the question ?  Yeah that paper is pretty much this book.
358, I've been using this product for over a year and it always works for me.  Even if I skip my morning shower, I never have underarm odor, and I'm one of those self-conscious women who discreetly lifts and sniffs. lolI admit that I do not perspire very much, even though I live in muggy Southwest Florida, but I will start to smell if I don't use a good deodorant. I needed a couple of add-on items to get free shipping, and Amazon's price is the same as my local Walmart, so now I won't run out for a long time.  By the way, it's really fragrance free and the gel formula is gentle.
359, I would recommend this to everyone. My daughter, husband and myself are all using it. It is so simple to use and understand. If you can not find the food listed you can use the information from the package and add it to the lists. I would never have believed I would be following this. It also made it simple to add exercise and using it for calorie information too. So far I do not have any complaints about it. I am using it on my Kindle Fire and love it.
360, Ordered two of these for the two steps on my new RV trailer. I noticed that after I took them out of their shrink wrap and removed the rigid cardboard inside, the material is cheap, flimsy outdoor carpeting with a few grommets and cheap tension springs to hold it in place. These are a bit overpriced. If you have the means to put grommets in a couple of pieces of outdoor carpeting, then do that. (you can buy grommets at most hardware stores). But, these work just fine. The back of the material is a bit 'sticky' so they don't slip off. They look nice, but buckle in the center on curved steps, like I have. If you're looking for something that is quick and easy, then get these. If you are innovative, make your own.
361, Bought this to use with my iPhone 3GS. When I plugged it in, I got the 'not for iPhone' charging message. Sure enough, it doesn't charge properly. The problem is that, even when I've taken care to make sure it's securely seated, it won't consistently charge, so there's no telling with any certainty when you unplug your phone in the morning, that it'll be charged.Callpod charges my old LG phone, my husband's Blackberry and my Nintendo DS, all flawlessly.  This adapter was a bust. Haven't tried it with my husband's iPod Touch, so can't say how it works for that device.
362, This changing pad cover works great on the Especially for Baby Contour Changing Pad. I have one in white and one in green (the green matches my Malawi bedding really well.) I washed and dried them many times. All of the stains came out and they stayed soft and didn't shrink much. I did have to stretch them a bit to get them on, but once in place they fit perfectly. The straps on the pad I have are attached at the bottom so I didn't need to cut any holes in the cover in order to be able to use the straps. I also use small changing pads so that I don't have to change and wash the cover that often. I like that I can put my baby on something soft and warm instead of the cold plastic pad. I definitely recommend getting these.
363, I've stumbled across some great series out of sheer boredom over the last year or so and this is one of them. The series starts out a little all over the place due to numerous flash back and some bouncing around from one character to another for what seems to be no reason, but it soon levels out as the story progresses. I wasn't keen on this method of story telling, but I stuck through it and I'm glad I did.It's a very interesting story with a new take on the whole, &#34;Are we alone in the universe&#34; question. Anything with a fresh idea is nice to see, in my opinion. There's a lot of back door conspiracy theory plot as well as some CIA like teams that go around &#34;cleaning up&#34; the people in the know. Very entertaining and should keep most viewers attention well through the season.
364, Here's an incredibly realistic account of the terraforming [areoforming?] of Mars in the mid 21st century. Written in the early 90's the details may be outdated by recent Rover and other explorations, but the vivid sense of place amid the weird geology of the red planet makes this first of a trilogy continue to spark thoughts days and weeks after reading it. I used the National Geographic maps of Mars as a reading aide, but found that I started thinking of Mars in terms of Robinsons books, and not just as a fictional construct.Like all great science fiction, the hard science is matched by the explorations into human existence, in this case, following the attempts by many of the 'first hundred' Martian settlers to opt out of the cycle of capitalism and global exploitation that at the time of the books, sees the earth searching desperately for resources off planet.  Various forms of anarchism and communalism are attempted, with various results, hampered always by interference from the global transnationals that run earth.
365, I don't like that this jean is not provided by Amazon.  I purchased two pairs of these jeans, one white and the other Latte size 10.  The white fit perfectly and the Lattie fit like a size 8.  These are great jeans if you are sent the correct size.  They are all made in different countries and that seems to be the problem.  And if the jeans are not provided by Amazon but a Florida company you will need to pay for returns which I think is wrong.  Evidently, this company has had a lot of problems with sizing so please do not buy from this company.
366, Too bad this series never went beyond season two. It has everything a good series should have. The characters are human rather than unrealistic and the viewer can relate to their situations. You found yourself drawn into the plot. That each episode largely stood alone didn't matter. You wanted to know what happened in the next episode because there was just enough plot carry over to keep you hooked. The series provided medical and social history in context and in a way that was simply fascinating. I learned things about the history of medicine that totally surprised me. This is a little like what happened to the series Firefly. Somewhere a group of executives are kicking themselves for cutting short a real money maker.
367, This episode is incredibly ludicrous.  The showdown features 1 Apache helicopter that takes about ten minutes to destroy two out of three bus's , get real...  There would have been half a dozen Apache's, and the game would have been over in seconds....  I can't believe anyone writing this would seriously believe that's the way it works, lol!!!!!  If you are going to use the military as part of your show, you need to hire a military adviser.  This is a cartoon.  The only reason I gave it three stars is because the acting was, for the most part good, effects not too bad, and the storyline could have been great, but really fell short.
368, I have been using this app for about a week and absolutely love it!  I was paying for weight watchers online for virtually the same services.  It allows you to put in your current weight, goal weight and how much you want to lose per week (up to a safe, healthy 2 lbs per week of course).  What I love is that it gives you an actual date that you should reach your goal if you follow the guidelines.  Anyone that is trying to lose weight or just become aware of their diet should definitely get this app!
369, We've been using this tub since our son was about 6 months old.  At first we used the infant position which worked great.  We got this when he was younger but since it doesn't have any padding we used instead a different tub until he was able to somewhat sit up (maybe he wouldn't have cared, but it looked painful).  After a year, he is still using it and fits perfectly in it. The tub went through a lot of banging, crayola drawing and stuff like that, but it looks great, and works like new.  The stopper has never leaked!
370, I have had acne since childhood and have tried almost every product under the sun to get rid of it. My sensitive skin transitioned to combination and was constantly red from all the products so finally I had had enough. This oil is amazing! A few drops covers my entire face as a moisturizer in the morning or can be blended with a moisturizer for a boost. It is lightweight and doesn't feel oily on.  I have left all my old harsh products behind and am using all natural now. I wish I would have done this years ago!
371, This is so handy.  I get about 175% charge on my Nexus S 4G (which admittedly has a battery on the smaller side compared to most phones today).  I use it when I travel and it works awesome.  I bought it before they changed the look/features of it and it looks even better now - the battery itself uses USB to charge (why didn't they do that in the first place?).  After dozens of uses, it still charges just as much as it did on the first day (I've had it for 5 months).
372, I'm not pleased with the quality or look.  I bought this same exact boot in brown many moons ago, and I absolutely love that pair.  Decided I needed a new black boot so ordered this one.  The leather feels thin and the boot looks cheap - definitely not up to standard of the boot I bought years ago.  It still has the same quality rubber sole and it fits fine so for the price of a little over $100 I guess it's okay, which is why I kept it, but I would look elsewhere or to another line.
373, Michael's voice as a child has never been out done till this day! Starting out as a soul singer he had the range and emotion to make any song pop with angst and beauty at the same time! Just listen to the closing lines of ABC! But the rare tracks are amazing too - the haunting and most poigant is &quot;When I Come Of Age&quot; Michael sings of his hopes and dreams of his adult years and rather he will be a &quot;mighty man&quot; or an &quot;astronaut&quot; We all know the drama which is Michael and this song is just amazing and is fitting for a man who dreamed of conquering childhood fancy only to live life as achild themself! Michael career has been groundbreaking but this collection only hints at his true genius as a soul singer in the likes of Marvin Gaye and Smokey Robinson it is expressed in more depth in the Jackson 5 SoulSation box set! This is a great starter kit for the experience enjoy!
374, If you like scheming, justice, complete DISREGARD for justice, rooting for and against different characters at different times, brutality, and the possibility of anyone being able to die at any given time then you'll love this series. Good luck trying to read this book to fall asleep at night. If you've already watched the HBO series just remember that NO television depiction has ever come close to fully capturing the books they came from. After you finish this series (whenever it ends) you'll be googling &#34;books like Game of Thrones&#34; to find your next read.
375, I suspect this battery is not new. If it is then it's defective. I'd bet this was a refurbished battery. This battery best performance equaled the performance of my original battery after I had it about a year. At best, it performed OK but nothing like a new battery. BTW - I purchased this battery in Aug 2011, I'm again looking to purchase it's replacement because one again, I find myself having to charge it on average twice per day.I will say I received the battery quickly. Kudos to the seller for that.
376, There is one by this same company made specifically for dresser type changing tables. I have it and love it. It is almost a necessity. Holds wipe warmer, diapers, diaper creme, hair brush/comb, some q-tips, powder, small bottle of lotion...you get it. It holds the essentials, not everything you bought for baby. Both are great, but it depends on the type of changing table you have. Or if you choose to use the top of a dresser like I did, you'll love the "Dresser Depot".
377, I love love love this unit, and make sure to bring it with me whenever I know I'm going to be out and about for the day, and my phone is not going to survive.  It's absolutely essential on plane flights, long days at the beach, etc. I cannot recommend this or some other type of external charging highly enough.  It's hard to be without your phone, so having this unit is a no brainer.  You can plug it in and put it in your pocket.  Easy
378, The simplicity of this design makes it invaluable and highly versatile. Rather than buying a more complicated, higher priced, and dedicated pump for specific tasks, this pump is able to be cleaned very easily and moved to the next job. You may not want to purchase this if you plan on filling up your supercharged V8 engine with oil, but for differential or pump oils, this is perfect. Both in filling *AND* removing, making flushes much simpler.Sometimes the most complicated designs call for the simplest tool to work on them, and this is just that- a simple tool which does exactly what it's intended to do. Nothing more, nothing less.
379, I waited many years to find a copy of this film. Looking back it may not have really been worth the wait and expense. The film, made for British televisionand shown in black and white on Boxing Day 1967 was a critical failure. Today its a colorful journey into a past thet no longer exists.The film features the bad on a "magical mystery tour" a bus ride with no particular destination where strange things happen. There is no more plot than that really and the film is simply an excuse for presenting some really great songs in the days before MTV.The film features videoes for The Fool on the Hill, Flying, I Am the Walrus, Blue Jay Way, Your Mother Should Know, Magical Mystery Tour and the impossible to find Death Cab For Cutie. Intermixed are scenes of wizards, a strip show and the stranges tent you've ever witnessed.This one is for die hard fans only but it is an enjoyable way to spend an hour. The standard definition DVD features the film and zero extras.
380, I was a fan of Spark People until I tried to download their app.....they charge $$ for their app!  This one is free!  I have switched to My Fitness Pal for both my cell phone and Kindle HD.  I keep track of everything I eat and so far I've lost 15 lbs in the first month!  It's easy to use; especially the scanner.  Just scan a product and it fills in the rest for you.  I plan on making a lifestyle change by sticking with this app.  WTG!!
381, Having had the original CD release for well over 10 years, this review focuses on the remastered sound in this edition.  I must say that the bass sound on this recording is phenomenal!!!  When you listen to James Jamerson's liquid lines on "Flying High," you'll know why he was the king of his instrument!!  Elsewhere, the remastering brings out little subleties that I had often missed listening to the original CD release.  My suggestion to Motown is that they lower the price of the 2 disc ultimate edition, as it is a little pricey.  With a lower price, I'd probably buy yet ANOTHER copy of one of the top 3 greatest albums ever!!
382, I needed a large funnel for adding an ammonia solution to a container for a diesel engine (DEF cannister) and did not want to try to empty a 2.5 gal container of the solution into the engine compartment and having the ammonia all over the place.The Hopkins funnel is large enough that it is an easy target for the liquid being used and it has a grip area so that if you have average size hands it is easy to hold on to it. If you have small hands the design is not going to work particularly well but it can be held by the rear section.
383, Apparently dissatisfied with the effect their music was having on a largely unsuspecting public lulled into soporific submission by the likes of Fleetwood Mac, The Eagles, and Peter Frampton, these Akron spud boys upped the ante in the strangeness sweepstakes when they moved into celluloid.This collection, comprised primarily of grainy videos hatched up before they were mistakenly tagged as a novelty outfit after MTV moved "Whip It" into heavy rotation, plays out like a movie night meet-and-greet at the old Eloise sanitarium on Michigan Avenue, the simian-like Booji Boy, General Boy, Rod and Donut Rooter, Daddy Know-It-All, Dr. Byrthfood, and Mongo the Mongoloid vying for screen time in order to bring the truth about de-evolution to the masses, in turn raising many questions about what may be in the drinking water and air above Akron, Ohio.It's possible those questions may never be answered.
384, Pros:The IMP52D is a convenient sized charger that includes an LED light and a red Laser light and a cloth bag to carry it and a USB cable.  I use it to keep my Motorola Droid Razr charged.  I am able to charge my phone a couple of times before having to recharge the unit.  The unit charges in a few hours.  I like the size of it as I can carry it in my pants or shirt pocket. This is our second New Trent charger and am pleased with both of them.Cons:NonePossible Improvements:The LED and Laser lights are nice but operationally the Laser light comes on when you press the power button for a second.  This actually could be unsafe especially if a child gets their hands on it.  The way in which the two lights come on should be reversed.
385, As a rule, I stay away from tube tops. They don't stay, they don't make me feel secure and I have always felt they don't look good on me. Enter the ISB adhesive. I was dismayed when I had wear a dreamy tube dress for a friend's wedding as a bridesmaid. A beautiful bird in the gym whispered this product and I am so glad I used it. I used it generously too - for the strapless bra as well as the dress. Danced some in it too and all things were in place at the end of the night :)Both the dress and I are free of any traces of the product. Every woman should have this.
386, I have heel spurs and one leg longer than the other.  I spend my shift plus more hours on my feet as a nurse.  I didn't want shoes that would become tight after hours on my feet.  These shoes fit true to size.  There is room for me to add the individually sized orthotic inserts that I had made to treat my heel spurs.  Also, the soles were amenable for the othortist to slice open and add an extra 1/2 inch lift for my shorter leg.  I like that I could order a nursing shoe in a basic black because I can wear either scrubs or jeans in my job and these go well with either.  If anything, they could use maybe a slight more amount of cushioning.  With the amount of time I spend on my aging feet, there may be no shoe that is perfect.
387, I have a tandem-axel trailer, and the suspension is such that when one tire is on this Leveler, the trailer is NOT lifted high enough to get the 2nd tire off the ground too.  This has the effect of putting unevenly distributed weight on the axels AND limiting the leveling effect.If you have a single axel, this will work GREAT.  I'm still giving this 5-starts based on it's solid construction and how easy it is to back up onto a stepped ramp.  But, if you have tandem axels AND their suspension is like mine...you'll need to pass on this one.  I gave mine to a friend with a single-axel tent-trailer, and he loves it.
388, I do like this product but can not say "I love it" because I am constantly looking for a good moisturizer.  MY face is sensitive and dry and it is difficult to find a product that isn't too greasy,too smelly,or too expensive.  I can't afford to buy $50.00 moisturizers; I am a retired 68 year old senior living on restricted budget; however I do care to look nice.  I do not like the dispenser, I would prefer a jar and not this pumping action.
389, THE OXFORD MURDERS is typical British cinema--cerebral, pondering and tedious.  While BBC's WAKING THE DEAD is excellent, this movie doesn't compare on any level.An interesting mystery is shrouded with mathematical mumbo jumbo which rises above the average viewer's knowledge or interest (like TV's NUMB3RS).LOTR's Elijah Wood uses his soulful eyes and little else in his wooden performance; John Hurt is excellent as always, and Julie Cox chews up the scenery.The movie's twist ending is surprising but gets anti-climactic execution.Primarily, it's just all rather boring.
390, Neutrogena lip balm is the same as Chap Stick SPF 15 without the 40% petrolatum. Neutrogena is clear, none tasting, no perfume, no wax, no PABA which is hard to find otherwise it has the same ingredients of Octinoxate and Oxybenzone. It is great when I am mountain biking but not great 1)in real hot weather or 2)surfing in the ocean. For that I use Carmex 15 in the tube since 1)tube is the best to hold in the ingredients when melting 2)nothing offers the protection of the petrolatum in the salty water of the ocean. Carmex is 90% Vaseline+wax but in a small tube with SPF 15.
391, Delivered today and looking forward to having this new cap to possibly get rid of the CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CODE for gas cap. WRONG CAP...they sent the one for a 2004 CHEVROLET SUBURBAN 1500 LS  FLEX FUEL ENGINE.....so don't trust the amazon CHECK car app to see if it matches your vehicle...this has been twice that the app has been wrong...anyway........THIS CAP IS FOR THE FLEX NOT THE NON FLEX FUEL ENGINE....DIF. IS THE FLEX IS THE SCREW CAP TYPE, THE NORMAL FUEL ENGINE IS A PLUG STYLE.........Once you open the package you can't it back, almost like burning 20ish dollar with a lighter....NOT a HAPPY CAMPER!
392, Having read all of Tom Clancy's books, this is the gem that stands out way above all the rest.  It has adventure and danger, as do all his books, but it deals with love and heartbreak to a degree not seen in his other books.  This book is very much about honor and duty, sacrifice and betrayal.  There are many segments of this book which are unforgettable!  This book is one of a kind in its genre and is well deserving of the label &quot;Modern  Classic.&quot;  In this book we see the beginnings of a central character in several Clancy books written earlier, but chonologically later in time, the enigmatic Mr Clark.  No problem is too difficult for Mr Clark in the other novels, and now we know why.  I strongly encourage all adventure/espionage genre fans to read this book, as well as other readers looking for a compelling read.  This is the best of Tom Clancy and that is saying something very strong indeed.
393, I have arthritis in my feet, my toes can really hurt in the morning especially. These Muk Luks are a treasure to anyone who has problem feet. They keep the feet warm and are perfect for those lazy days around the house. The bottoms are soft leather and the wool is absolutely non-itch inducing. I've had problems with wool against my skin but not with these. As soon as Amazon gets my size back in stock I will order another pair. One word of warning, I wear a men's size 9 1/2 shoe and I followed the advice of several prior reviewers and ordered a size up, Large (10-11), and they are snug which is perfect for warmth and comfort. So I also would recommend getting one size larger.
394, The first three books were page turners and I enjoyed most of the fourth installment.  Unfortunately, ADWD is somewhat of a bore.  The details and numerous characters are fine, but the story is told from too many perspectives which waters down the storytelling.  Early in the series, the original characters were so well-crafted, so real that they really became alive and got under my skin.  By this fifth book, it seems more like an accounting of everything rather than a story.  Nothing really happens.  I can honestly say, it wouldn't have taken away much to simply read a synopsis and skip this book altogether.  Martin needs to consider how frustrating this is to those who've read and enjoyed the first books since who else would buy the fifth?
395, I've been using Mrs Meyers Clean Day products for over a year now and love them all.The dishsoap is gentle on my hands. I've tried all of the scents but basil has been my favorite so far.This soap is not a big sudser.  I suggest to refrain from adding more than necessary to get more suds. A little goes a long way. I made this error when I first tried the brand and even though I rinsed my dishes well, I could taste the soap in some of the cups.  I do not recommend tasting it!  However, for cleaning, I give it 5-stars.
396, This concert has its moments... I saw the group live in 1985 touring after 'Brothers In Arms' was released and that concert was definitely better than this one... also saw them live in 1988 with Eric Clapton.On the debit side, Mark Knopfler's vocals are rather weak at times on 'Alchemy', and he has a tendency to change the lyrics. This version of 'Romeo And Juliet' is a stinker.  The best tracks by far are 'Sultans of Swing', 'Tunnel of Love' and most of all 'Telegraph Road'.
397, I was overall quite happy with this mount. It stuck to the windshield well. It held my device well. It was quite adjustable (allowing both landscape and portrait mode and easy changing between them).But after only 6 months, the ball joint failed and could no longer support any weight. This meant that my phone screen just flopped downwards and pointed at the floor (in any orientation). After trying to deal with this, I finally had to remove it from my vehicle because it was causing dangerous driving conditions and it was better to just hold the phone in my hand than to deal with the defective mount.Good design, but poor quality materials or build quality.
398, I love Under Armour sweatpants. The look is pretty stylish, especially considering sweatpants are typically not considered as such. The outside is somewhat  shiny/smooth, not like your everyday sweats. There is no elastic band on the bottoms, so they hang loose and dug hug your ankles. The inside is fleece, so I personally wouldn't use these to workout in, as I feel it'd be too hot. But that's just my preference. I generally wear them when it's too cold for shorts and I'm too lazy to wear jeans.One word of advice: Don't be a dope and run them through the dryer! Clearly not paying attention, I threw two pairs of these into the dryer after washing them. Result: Two pairs of medium men's sweatpants now fit for a small child. Looks like I'll be buying a few new pair come fall...
399, we tried these nipples after using the Nuk orthodontic latex nipples because we needed to step up the flow and Nuk doesn't make their nipples in anything other than a slow flow (at least, i couldn't find them if they do). however, my breastfed baby did not like them. the base of the nipple looks more rounded in the images than it is--it's actually quite flat. we found that our son preferred something he could put his whole mouth around, as it would more closely resemble nursing. these nipples were a no-go. we ended up just making the hole bigger in the Nuk nipples and that seemed to do the trick. it's too bad Nuk doesn't make a medium flow nipple, but these definitely were not a good alternative.
400, I bought this tub after reviewing almost all the other comparable tubs on here! My son was 5 months old when I bought it, and he is now 14 months... it works great for us! He is just starting to outgrow the small side (and he is very long for his age), so we just switch him to the other side or put him in the big bathtub if we wish. I love that this tub is BPA free, and it cleans/dries very well. It is large, but has plenty of room for your child as he/she grows. One of my most useful buys!
401, Tragically, the life of this poet and rapper has been cut short in its prime. Tupac prophesied his own early demise. And he moved toward that end with fatalism worthy of a Greek tragedy.All Eyez on Me is a set of two CDs that are among the greatest rap has ever produced. Despite his outward insistence on thuggishness, Tupac was very sensitive, far more so than the average thug, or any average person for that matter. Sensitivity led to originality and an important cultural product. Tupac celebrates thug life, along with its pain and its doom.The beats and the production on this album are great and go so well together with Tupac's rhymes. Tupac was a genius who made a commitment to live out his life as a thug and kept it. This was his mission, and he felt he needed to fulfill it, with all eyes staring at him, even those who refused to C him...
402, As others have mentioned, the ads are annoying and deceptive. I did not have "3 missed calls" on my Kindle Fire because my Kindle Fire is not a phone! :LOL: That said, my primary gripe is that the games themselves follow a formula, i.e., in the "Hard" section, you only use one type of logic to solve any of the games, as opposed to those you might find in sudoku magazines which require different solving logistics. While this is okay if you are a beginner at sudoku, it gets boring fast if you're an experienced puzzler. I've only been using the app for a month and already I'm thinking about removing it from my device.
403, The good: It works on the Coby Kyros. Yay!Alas, this doesn't emulate the eight ball of my youth, because that eight ball wasn't filled with crummy commercials. Other than that, it's delightful - I personally love shaking it like my old eight ball (which suffered a tragic accident at the paws of a wildly opportunist kitty, and ruined my Mother's beige shag carpeting forever. Sniff.).However, nothing impedes my magickal sensibilities like an ad for Geico when I am trying to disseminate the sekrits of the known universe.I am aware developers need to be paid - I'll pay! Please, just give me that option.
404, This is a great app for calorie counting. It also tracks how many calories you burn exercising. But... be careful what personal information you put into the app. There is a corresponding on line app. As soon as you set up your account (and do not put your real name in your username), go online and adjust your privacy settings. No what you set your privacy settings to - your username and picture will always be visible.I really like this app though and it works great on the Kindle Fire. Also nice to check my progress online from time to time.
405, I bought this because "others" bought it with the case I purchased. It was one of those last minute "checkout" decisions. I should have read the reviews better. Worked for a day after I received it then my 4th Gen iPod touch gives a message the charger isnt supported. The reviews are a little scary. The last thing I want is to fry my iPod. Not sure if I will bother returning it considering the price. I will probably keep the retractable cable and toss the chargers.
406, A trio of strong performances highlights this three-character thriller from England.  The film wastes no time in establishing its familiar kidnapping scenario.It's what happens once Alice is taken that elevates it beyond the routine crime caper.  There are some unexpected plot twists and an unexpected climax.  Gemma Arterton's Alice is a complex victim, and she does extremely good job in a difficult role.  Martin Compston is Danny, the "gentler" kidnapper dominated by his older partner.  He uses his boyish charm to belie his darker nature.  But it is Eddie Marsan as the mastermind who dominates the film.  Marsan's inspired performance gives us both the hardened pro and the softer, almost pathetic side.  A performance of depth and complexity.ALICE CREED is not always easy to watch but it is good movie-making.
407, This review refers to the abridged audio book, read by David Dukes.The story was entertaining enough, but Mr. Dukes' reading was quite disappointing. He seemed to squeeze all of Mr. Clancy's many characters into one of a few vocal catagories: noble, pinched, gruff, and female. (The &quot;female&quot; voice, a too-soft falsetto southern belle, was particularly painful.) Many passages began with Mr. Dukes reading spoken dialogue which I mistook for a completely unintended character. Also, his voice tends to taper off at the ends of his sentances, I suppose for dramatic effect. I often got the impression that Mr. Dukes was thinking, &quot;Man, I really sound cool reading this really cool book...&quot;FYI - On a side note, I'm not a fan of written or verbal profanity, and this book has more than its fair share.
408, this is one of the worst concert films ive ever seen and i own lots of them.  im a casual Police fan, never thought they were a top flight band, but i did like alot of thier songs.  whoever directed this film needs to be slapped, constant shots of the knuckleheads in the crowd and one entire song is like looking into a strobe light for 5 minutes,  you could have a seizure, seriously.  the police is an average live act at best, but this could have been a decent concert film if not for the idiotic "production values".
409, This tub is the best- I wish I had bought it sooner. We had a 4 stage tub for our son, but he got really big and it didn't fit any more. I saw this tub listed in Baby Bargains (great book!) and decided to try it. I never used it for my son when he was an infant, but you can put the baby in one way and they recline, then face them the other way once they can sit up.This thing is fabulous! My son has a ton of room to splash around and play. In fact, now he hates to get out of the tub since has so much fun in there. The tub also has a spot to hold shampoo and bath wash bottles.
410, This was a reliable phone.  The battery would last more than a day, even with heavy texting and data on.  I miss this, and actually would prefer it to my Sprint Galaxy S3, which had miserable battery life.  T-Mobile had great service as well, and as soon as I left T-Mobile for Sprint, I regretted it and made plans to get back.The biggest drawback of this phone was the small screen.  The browser makes all website and email text into a standard font, so you get text that is large enough to read even if a website is not responsive.  Still, reading a website on the tiny screen is tedious.
411, These are good basic bottles.  Going to the baby store and shopping for baby bottles as a new parent was daunting.  There's a litany of choices and every imaginable variation on design.  How do you choose?  For us, it became simple when we decided to stick to glass bottles.  There aren't many choices out there in glass, and those that are available are usually very expensive.  Our daughter has had no problems eating whatsoever so I can't say anything about any of the specialty bottles on the market, but for most babies, I can't imagine needing more than a basic bottle.  These are more or less the time tested glass baby bottle.  Basic and no frills, but solid and sturdy.  We like them a lot, and the price is very affordable.
412, CARPENTERS-GOLD is simply a re-release of the VHS &quot;Yesterday Once More&quot;, but with a 5.1 remix thrown in, and slightly better picture quality.  These two extra features are good reason to buy the DVD, but not enough to justify the high price tag.  What's really missing with this DVD?  To begin with, A&amp;M have failed to recognise the value of DVD techonology which allows for considerable space on the disc.  Many more film clips could have been added, as well as a documentary ... but sadly none of these are provided.  It really doesn't deserve the title of &quot;Gold&quot;, perhaps &quot;Silver plated&quot; would be more fitting?Would love to see some real LIVE performances of Karen Carpenter.  When are we getting a live DVD because material does exist.
413, I bought this moisturizer for my 93 year old mother. She was very overweight when she came to live with us and had a lot of loose skin under her chin. She had lost over 25 pounds since living with us, and much of the hanging skin under her chin is gone. Although some of this is due to the weight loss, I believe this cream has helped. I have used it on her every night for the last year and a half, and the chin is disappearing in addition to wrinkles on her face. For 93, she looks pretty darn good.
414, This is a great fully integrated product. Wish it was thinner in size, but hey, you can't have it all - there needs to be size for the battery itself! For someone that needs to have a small protable charging unit, this is a must buy. The built in laser pointer is awesome and it feels really good when used as a laser pointer. The built in light is really handy when the power goes out or for emergency lighting situations such as trying to find a key hole at night. Wish it had a mini USB port, but it does come with a standard USB as well as a micro USB port that it can be charged from. This unit is small enough to carry in my iPad bag and provides enough power to last a day on the road. It can be charged almost anywhere. Highly recommended for the mobile worker.
415, If you are a bigger guy then you know all about the magic that is fishing shirts! These shirts do run big, but they fit so well. You can move and bend and it doesn't get tight. The Columbia brand specifically seems to be a GREAT brand on this shirt. I have had no trouble with shirts fading or buttons falling out.  What is also nice is that they are long so you can bend over without your lower back falling out.  Really a great product, but know that they run a little big. If you have experience with these shirts then you know all about it.
416, I had used this brand years ago and never had a problem. When my most recent tube of another brand ran out, I went back to the soft black great lash but the very first day I used it, my eyes felt dry and itchy - I thought it was odd and as normal, washed off all my makeup that night taking care to remove everything around my eyes. The next morning, my eyes felt worse - crusty red and irritated. Took some visine, thought maybe some soap had gotten in my eyes and that was the problem. Applied makeup as usual including this mascara, same day time issues, same problem the next morning with red irritated eyes. Being stubborn I tried it again day 3 - same problems. Nothing else in my regime changed except this mascara. Now I am reading reviews on this same brand in blackest black that there is something causing the same problems for many other users. Something is up with Maybelline. I would take it back to the store if I kept the receipt. No star.
417, I love this product its not to small and not to big the led flashlight works great for leaving work at night or coming home at night the lazer light works great for work presentations or walking a store and pointing out product in the oberhead  I have a iphone 4s it charges it to a full charge once and a half for my galaxy note 2 or my galaxy s3 it charges it almost to a full charge so either of my phone makes it through a 12 hour work day and more  I definately would recomend this product to anybody that needs a extra charge
418, No More Color is a awesome release from the 3 member band Coroner. With some awesome guitar work and drumming, No More Color retains the true thrash spirit, all the riffs are downright thrasy, yet un-repetitive unlike some lesser SF thrash bands. &quot;Die By My Hand&quot;, &quot;D.O.A.&quot; and &quot;Read My Scars&quot; are probably the best songs on here, most of the songs are tru thrashy goodness, only a couple are repetitive. Bottom Line, If you like german (and swiss) speed metal bands like Kreator, Destruction, and Celtic Frost, or you want to escape some of the mediocare SF thrash *cough*Forbidden*cough*, you MUST buy this album.
419, actually really liked this product. Overall the item is really portableand the design is very slick. Also the LED light and laser pointer make itreally ideal for the person to carry it around at the office or to work.Also it would be great to store in your car since sometimes i would dropcoins or a pen in my car at night and need to find it and the LED lightwould be perfect for that. The product also can charge my s3 and ipad tofull before it is drained. Also works for the new iphone 5 and ipad withretina display. The charge time is also fairly short which makes it idealfor if you're on the move and short on time. I would recommend this product.
420, I like Mrs. Meyer's products very much as generally they perform well and are safe to use. Thus far Lavender is my favorite since it smells like a moderate strength lavender;Geranium as it smells like a bushel of real roses (a bit overpowering); and then Basil for its very, very too light floral scent. I thought Snap Pea smelled like cut grass that had been sitting in a closed plastic bag and opened a week later. Although the suds/grease cutting  power is not as strong as Dawn, Mts. Meyer's product is much better than Seventh Generation's or Ecover's dish washing liquid soap. Of course it is also more expensive than the other 2 brands, as all 3 usually have an Amazon coupon offer at one time or another throughout the year.
421, I used to play this album back in 1976 all the time, and thankfully, still have it on vinyl, and, without a lot of scratches.  I do wish I had it in C.D. form, but, for what people here are asking for it, no thanks, I'll just use my turn table!!!  This is one of Diana's very best albums of the 70's,  Get this is you can, you will so enjoy hearing Diana's classic 70's voice again.
422, I work by first doing the 1s then 2s, etc, so I really like the new option to pick a number and then touch all the spaces where you want it placed. It got rid of half the keypresses required.However, I do wish it could remember that you like to work this way and default it... Since I only do the hard and extreme and my train ride only allows me to do this for about 10 minutes, it usually takes more than one train ride to do a puzzle.  When I start/re-start a puzzle, I forget to push the "#/123" button first and I accidentally change a cell when I all I meant to do was select a # for later changing a cell.btw... # is not number in this case, it is referring to the grid pattern.  123/# means numbers first.  #/123 means grid first.For how I do sudoku, I much prefer this over any of the iPad versions I have seen.
423, The article arrived at the promised time, I didn't have any problems with the purchase, the watch is of good design, as shown by the images, please take into account that it is not a formal watch, it is ideal for camping or sports, it is a small box, if you have a very large doll might not like it, as it can be seen, as the brand is always faithful to his style and manufactures good quality watchescame in its original packaging, very well protected and all its functions to perfection
424, As Season 2 opens, the Doctor has transformed into a new body, played by my favorite Doctor, David Tennant.  Rose is trying to adjust to the fact that the man who saved her life has a new body & the Doctor is needed before he's fully evolved, to defend London from mad Santa's & evil Christmas trees.  The Doctor/Rose bond has been well-established & Rose & her family help to defend the Doctor until he awakes fully renewed.  Lots of adventure & like Season 1, you have to love the Doctor!Great BBC series, with fantastic aliens, travel to far-away places in the Tardis, interesting problems & the companionship of Rose & the Doctor.  I recommend this series as one of the best!
425, ...or so my older friends tell me.  We were given a Diaper Genie for a shower gift and it proved so invaluable in the baby's nursery upstairs, we bought a second one for our downstairs changing table.  (we had been wrapping each diaper in a plastic bag and throwing them in the garbage - yuck!)Keep the instructions until you get the hang of loading your Genie - the Genie comes loaded with the first roll of plastic, and we had some trouble figuring out how to load the next roll because we didn't have the practice from the first roll and had misplaced the instructions.  It is easy to load but not so easy to figure out how it loads if you aren't paying attention or are sleep-deprived.
426, We got this as a gift at our baby shower two years ago. I am very glad we did. This is almost a MUST have for babies.The range is fantastic. I can be outside watching my two year old while my baby sleeps. I know that I will be able to hear her. Not only is the range great but it also picks up the smallest sounds, I hear my baby rolling over in her crib when this is on. As an added bonus, I have not found this to be a battery eater.In my opinion having a moniter is not the most important thing to have if you are having a baby. However, it is one of the more useful things if you want to have some measure of freedom while the baby is napping or if your child sleeps clear across the house from where you sleep.
427, I would imagine anything made of 100% cotton is liable to shrink, common sense will tell you that.  To reduce shrinkage, wash in cold water only and dry at lowest heat setting in your dryer, better yet, dry outdoors on a clothes line.  I have to wear the black colored ones for work and so far after multiple washing, no fade in the color.I take size Medium and when I bought them they looked awfully big, but after the first washing, they fit perfectly.  I do think Hanes allows for the shrinkage.Highly Recommended
428, 2 great tracks weighing in at just over 6 minutes each. The tracks here are far more focused and concentrate on building up. There are no vocals (which I kind of prefer, although Slint's narration style vocals are great), the music is very fuzzed out and is reminiscent of a more punked out Explosions In The Sky.Some say this is their best work. I say it is among their best work. If the tracks where longer and more developed, with a higher degree of build up / release, then 5 stars would have been awarded. For the price and considering its still available, you should get this right away as no Slint fans or post-rock fans would be let down.p.s at the end of the last track their is a buzzing drone for about 30 seconds with the music slowly dying in the background. This part can really fcuk with ones head when high.
429, The box was really impressive, I was really shocked at the presentation of the headphones, until I tried getting it out of the box, it took some work just to use it.Once out, it was pretty straight forward, plug right into my iPhone started playing music and the sound was great, overall, the set is a bit heavier than the Apple headphones, but the sound has more depth.I also made calls using the headset and it works as expected, the click of the microphone answers the call.  The person on the other end of the conversation didn't complain about hearing me and felt the quality was good for being a hanging microphone.I've been experimenting with the different earpieces to find the ones that will provide the most comfort for the 8-10 hours that I have them in.
430, The public tends to forget the impact that the Carpenters had in the 1970's - selling over 100 million records.  This set contains wonderfully remastered hits with the videos that accompanied them.  Mind you, this was before songs were made into videos and the outfits were frightening (but then again, what were we wearing back then)?  You can blame the A&amp;M executives for the wholesome appearance of the duo.  They thankfully were other than they appeared.The music is the main focus here and the videos are merely the means to show them.  Sure, Karen's apparent health varies from song to song, but the voice is always strong.&quot;The Carpenters: Close To You&quot; makes a great video companion piece and sheds an enormous amount of light on who the Carpenters really were.  However, if you just want the music, stick with this video.  It's full of memories and great songs!
431, We got these becasue our new house has a brick fireplace with an elevated ledge.  Our daughter was just learning to walk when we moved in and as part of our baby-proofing we decided we needed something for the fireplace.  This was about the only option BRU had and it was a waste of money.  It didn't fit together right and then the adhesive didn't stick to the brick.  Plus when it was on our daughter seemed to be drawn to it! It never failed she wanted to go right to it and try to get it up.  So we just took it up and she's been fine without anything on it.  In fact, she's pretty much left it alone since we took this off.
432, I have a lot of thick, long, hair which does not like to stay curled. This has been the first inexpensive curling iron to work on my hair.  It gives me neat sprial curls from top to bottom. I've read some of the other comments regarding a dent that the iron can leave...I've never gotten the dent...maybe its the way they position the iron.I also recommend using Salon Grafix's freezing hairspray if you have difficulty getting your hair to hold a curl.  This has been the only hairspray that holds my hair.The iron heats up quick, it also has the turbo heat option which allows it to heat up in a minute.I would recommend this iron for anyone!
433, I must say I loved The Beatles in "Help!" & "A Hard Day's Night", & I just got this movie from the library today.  It's terrible...there's no plot.  The music was alright; it seems like every movie they made Ringo seems to be the center of attention, (nothing wrong with that). George only has a couple of lines in the movie (I should say words), which is weird.  There were a few slightly funny scenes in the movie.  Like when John was with the little kid on the bus, & when the man was singing on stage with the stripper.  The spaghetti scene was nasty.  I wouldn't want to buy this movie; only if it's very cheap, just to have it for my up coming Beatles collection.  If anyone really wants to see this moive; I'd get it at the library first.  I'm sticking with "A Hard Day's Night" & "Help!"
434, I've had the pleasure of using this products for a view days now, and I really enjoy using this.I would like to see the cables built in like some of their other products, but love the fact that there are cables included with a small carrying pouch.I would also like to see a built in outlet charger, although I love the smaller size of the product.I was able to charge my Droid Razr to 100% and still had 2 lights left on the charger.  So I could probably get close to another full charge of the Razr before needing to recharge this unit.  I don't do alot of traveling but always want to be prepared, I really could have used this last year when the power went out for a couple days, and the only way I could charge things was via my car charger.  This would have been so great to have on hand then.  I have numerous products from this company, so everyone in my family will have one in case of emergencies.
435, After years of moving a single battery charger to trickle charge a half dozen batteries over the winter months I finally broke down and bought the 4-bank battery tender. It's sure convenient and with all the computer circuitry is probably a lot nicer to the batteries than I've ever been. Package came with four clamp type leads and four ring-type leads that are probably meant for installation on battery posts if you want to leave the battery in the vehicle and trickle charge it without removal.  The various leads simply swap out on quick disconnects for added convenience. Anyway, after a month of operating all the lights are green..that's good!
436, We got this free with a $75 purchase at Toys R Us so we took our original choice off of our registry.  Maybe we just got a bad one because the other reviews seem to be favorable.  Unlike the others, I didn't think it was that clear.  Yes, you can hear the baby breathe but there is also a static sound like air rushing through.  If you can sleep with &quot;white noise,&quot; you may be OK but it drives me nuts.  Also, our batteries have lasted an average of 3 - 5 days.  After going through 6 of them, we started using the plug full time.  This is a hassle because you have to unplug and replug it every time you change rooms.  I don't have any other monitors to compare it to but I don't think it's so great.
437, I was told about this incredible cream by my brother-in-law MANY years ago. As a contractor, his hands are often chapped and dry and, as a man, he HATES putting on any type of cream. This one is different, he said, because it works, period!!!  It has a slight, very pleasant fragrance and absorbs quickly.  I tried it then and there and have used it ever since because it works. I carry this tube size when I travel, but also love the large tub it comes in for home. It goes on smoothly, absorbs super fast, and stays on well. I use it in my hands and feet. Absolutely LOVE this product and will always use it.
438, I ordered this product after lots of research, but still without expecting much in the way of it actually working. I had just disconnected my home phone and moved it to a cell phone in order to keep the number and save money. It was frustrating not being able to always hear the phone and I didn't want to keep moving it all the time. Got the XLink, which is way smaller than I thought it was going to be - thankfully. Plugged it in, got my cell phone to sync with the unit. It works FABULOUS! All my cordless phones throughout the house work perfectly. No interference or static. Incredible product and so thrilled that I ordered it. Now I have the best of both worlds - a lower phone bill AND house phones. Definitely recommend this product to everyone.
439, I am very experienced with Sudoku puzzles, and don't want help screens, etc.  This app is designed for people who want to be able to put all the possible correct answers for the cell into the cell in very small fonts.  When you pick the correct answer it continues to display in tiny font near the edge of the cell; either high or low or left or right.  At a glance, it's very difficult to see which cells you have filled in because of the offset placement and tiny font.  With my visual learning orientation this was so cumbersome that I solved one puzzle and removed the app from my Kindle Fire device.  IMHO - if you're over 40 find a different Sudoku app before you go blind.  I like my optometrist, but only want to visit once per year.
440, My daughter used to pick her lips to the point that they were crusted over with blood every morning. I put this on her nails and told her that it was yucky. The first time she picked her lips she realized that it was the truth and she never picked her lips again. I also used it on the door stoppers that the cat was chewing on, and on the tiny (swallowable) toys that my husband just had to buy my son. He put it in his mouth once, spit it out and complained of how yucky it tasted. I got a bit of this on my finger and realized it later when I licked frosting off of my finger. Its bitter and just yucky.
441, In Square Circle makes it plain that the 70's are over(at least in the case of Stevie's music),but his melodic gifts makes this a worthwhile album and the best of his musical phase that began with the post-Musiquarium period.Part Time Lover is a deserved #1 song(as well as his last),and Overjoyed is the most beautiful song ever recorded.Other strong cuts includes I Love You Too Much,Whereabouts,&amp;Never In Your Sun.Go Home about the love rejected,now regretted scenario may have sounded good on paper but doesn't hold up on repeated listens.The albums weakest moment are his social conscience songs(Spiritual Walkers,The Land of LaLa,It's Wrong)showing how much we miss the Stevie Wonder of Innervisions.ISC may not have the soul of his 70's recordings,but his heart is in the right place.
442, This was the fifth Clancy book I have read but my first in many years. Without giving much away it is mainly a story of revenge. In this book you get to see how some of the regular characters in other Clancy novels come to be. I thought the book was fine & if you are just starting out the book does  pick up the pace once you get one or two hundred pages in. I didn't rate this book higher because I feel the story could have been done with less than 750 pages, that's two pretty good sized books. Also much of the book takes place in Vietnam & details some Navy Seal / SOG action. I have recently read the book "SOG" by John Plaster & I have to say the action in that book is hard to beat - & it was hard for me not to compare the two. Without Remorse does finish with a bang just for me it took a little long to get there.
443, Can't go wrong with tossing this is your bag before a trip or a conference where you need juice! Laser pointer is fun to mess with the cat with but the pack itself is too bulky to be used as a dedicated laser for meetings, etc. I guess it would work as a backup in a pinch but don't buy this for the pointer. The same can be said about the flashlight.The battery pack works great but you need to make sure your phone is good enough on 1A. Otherwise, this pack will drain faster than it can &#34;re-fuel&#34; your device. If that is the case, like say for my ATT S4 which needs 2.1A to rightfully charge, the best way to use it is with the phone turned off and charging, say mid-flight. Worked much better back on my S2 or my Fiancee's S3 (no our last name won't be Samsung).
444, First, many here have written reviews, commenting about the size/fit.  I am an honest 36/37 waist (for Wrangler jeans, 36 fits me well, as a guide), and I ordered &#34;Size Large&#34;.  The pants fit very well, with just the proper amount of &#34;looseness&#34; at the waist.  The length appears to be equal to a 32&#34; length, and again the fit &#34;just right&#34;.The fabric is also &#34;just right&#34;, slightly heavier than, say &#34;Dockers Kahki's&#34;, but not as heavy as, say &#34;Wrangler blue jeans&#34;.  I also like the camo pattern, which is exactly as shown in the picture.  Can't say much more, except, I'm seriously considering ordering another pair, but may wait until I wash these several times.  If I see any changes after washing, I will update this review, but at this point, I couldn't be more pleased.
445, I've loved and used Olay Regenerist for a few years now -- the fragrance and the feel of it on my skin was a daily little luxury.  Recently though, after giving myself a mini-peel to freshen my skin, I found the Olay Regenerist stung a bit when I applied it.  So I gave the fragrance-free version of Olay Regenerist a try and found it was quite soothing to my drying, flaking skin.  I think I'll stick with the fragrance-free version from now on, though I really did like the scent of the regular Olay Regenerist.No matter which one you try, I don't think you can find a better facial moisturizer.
446, During the winter months I take a lot of baths, which can leave my skin dry. I already useAveeno Active Naturals Daily Moisturizing Lotionbecause they work well on my skin and I decided that it would be worth it to try their bath products. I orderedAveenos Active Naturals Stress Relief Foaming Bathsimply because of the name; who doesn't need some stress relief?The scent is nice without being overpowering and it made lots and lots of bubbles which is a must for me. It left my skin feeling soft afterwards and overall I liked it.  The only downfall is the price and only because I tend to use more than is probably recommended so the bottle doesn't last as long as I would like.
447, I began using this application to track my food.  It became my ultimate diary.  I can add updates from my Kindle Fire, my Smartphone and my laptop.  It all synchronously updates regardless of the device used.  I wouldn't normally pay for any app, but this one could easily get money because it is worth it.Try using the Bar code scan function often.  It is so easy to do with your Smartphone.  I add my own recipes too.  What more could you want from a tool that truly shines?
448, This was my very first Diana Ross record. Which I still have.  What an amazing live concert preserved on vinyl back then.Now available on CD. I completely agree with the other reviewers with their statement that listening to this albums transport you back to the concert. I can imagine how exhausted Ms. Ross was after each presentation.I recall watching the tale &#34;The point&#34; on televison. Narrated by Ms. Ross in this concert is magical. Her tributes to Motownand the &#34;working girls&#34; musical legacy is worth every penny spent for this album.I saw &#34;DianaRoss Live in concert&#34; in 1994, I paid a very high price for my ticket which at the time of the concert did not really matter. However, that concert was far away from the quality of &#34;An evening with Diana Ross.&#34;Too bad that &#34;An evening with Diana Ross&#34; is not available on DVD.
449, makes my face more oily and the smell of tea tree is horrible. Didn't help much on pimples but it did excellent on my skin tag, yehey. I just soak my skin tag with a dot of the cream and cover it w/ bandage overnight. I did it for I think 3-4consecutive days then after that, the skin tag became painful and turned black. I tried to pull it but it's very painful so I left it. THe following day, it fell off by itself, and it's gone, THank God!!
450, I originally bought this product from my dermatologist office, and later found it on Amazon for a better price. This is the best facial wash I've ever used. It leaves oily skin clean and smooth without over drying. I will never look for a new product again! I'm very pleased with Obagi products.*update* I still use this wash and love it, but I've given up on the Obagi eye creams. They are nice, but I can't justify the price because they only moisturize my skin, as opposed to the other things they claim to do. But this wash is the best -- time to order more!
451, When my hand-me-down Diaper Genie broke, I bought a Diaper Champ. I figured I'd save some money not having to buy the Diaper Genie refills.Once I started using something different, I realized immediately just how wonderful the Diaper Genie really was. The odor protection the Diaper Genie provides is much superior to that of the other diaper pail. When I used the Diaper Genie, my son's room never smelled. With the other product, his room smelled horribly, even when I changed it daily!And, I found that the Diaper Genie really isn't any harder to use, and that it is much more pleasant to change, since all the diapers are sealed when you open the lid.Well, I'm back to using a Diaper Genie. Save your money and buy one the first time around. You'll have to spend a little more on refills, but your house won't smell, which really is the point behind a diaper pail.
452, This show, which is based on newspaper articles, hospital records, and patient memoirs, recounts the stories of both caregivers and patients at a hospital at the turn-of-the century in London's East End.  Many facts are given about healthcare at that time, and at the end of each show, there are also updates about what happened to certain characters.  I have learned a great deal: many children were alcoholics, technicians in charge of taking early x-rays were subject to radiation burns and death; there was a growing realization about the importance of cleanliness, although gloves were not yet worn.  The characters are well-cast: the hospital matron especially is able to convey the deep concern for patients but yet the sadness she feels at not being able to marry because nurses were not allowed to continue working once wed.  The show is entertaining and informative.
453, I like these things and got them to place under the scissor stabilizers.  The only reason I rated them at four stars is that they are a little bit smaller than the stabilizer pads, which I didn't realize when I ordered them (didn't compare sizes).  That means they can dig into the ground a little more due to more pressure.  I have had to adjust the stabilizers sometimes because of that.  The underside is a squared web design that also allows for ability to &#34;sink&#34; into the ground.
454, I have to admit when I opened the packaging I was surprised.  The quality of this item was above what was expected.  Heavy duty rigid plastic.  A pleasant surprise.  On the trailer end fitting ... there are 4 dog-ear catches rather than the 2 shown in the product photo.  An &#34;ear&#34; breaking off a 2-eared latch was why I had to buy a replacement.  The added end - allows you to use your drain hose for an extension is also great.  Two good quality hose clamps.  In summary, it is very nice to open a package and find an item whose quality exceeds what you expected.  I would recommend this item.  Oh, shipping.  Ordered Monday.  Have it in hand Wednesday.  Go Amazon!
455, I bought these at my local Firestone because there was a special on wiper blades. I paid 8 dollars for a pair.I needed replacement wiper blades as my OEM Nissan ones were starting to streak.I cleaned my windshield and put these wiper blades on. First rainy day came after 2 months of putting them on and they STREAK. These are TERRIBLE blades. My OEM Nissan ones that were older than these Bosch Blades streaked less!I didn't expect this from Bosch at all!It was past the 30 day return so I can't return them at all. Stuck with them until the next Fall.I do not recommend.
456, We use the diaper depot for our Pack and Play playard. It's not a perfect fit, but it works, and it sure beats running around to get diapers, wipes, etc. I gave the diaper depot 5 stars despite two things:1) The opening for the diaper stacker is a little big, so sometimes an extra diaper slides out. In Prince Lionheart's defense, this may be necessary to accomodate larger sized diapers.2) The side containers could have been a little deeper.Besides these minor nuiances, it's a great product.
457, There is no sex or gratuitous violence, there is no swearing or people plotting to ruin each other.  It is a story about dedicated people doing the best they can in horrific circumstances.  It is superbly filmed,  the characters are complex like all humans are but never explored in most mass media,  the actors are the best I've seen and the story is riveting.  So.....where is the continuing story?  I suppose we will not have any more of it,  it is just that good and does not fit into the modern story of greed, vengeance, murder, demons and  vampires.....This one makes you want to be a better person after you watch.
458, This was my first time playing casino style blackjack, and I really enjoyed it. This app was really easy to use. I had no trouble getting the hang of it and I'm not really a card game person. So I think if you enjoy card games you would probably really enjoy this one. You can purchase more chips if needed but so far I haven't needed to. This game gives  you plenty of opportunities to win more chips and it gives you hints and tips as you go along so you may not have to spend any real money.
459, .This 1990 concert was part of the tour to promote &quot;Nearly Human,&quot; and thus highlights songs from one of Todd's most melodic and interesting albums, with a solid non-Utopian band (additional guitarist, keyboards, bass, drums, sax, trumpet, and backing vocalists).  The greater number of personnel allows for more diverse arrangements, and no edge has been sacrificed.  The songs drive hard, and include a number of other standards such as &quot;Love of the Common Man&quot;, &quot;Real Man,&quot; and &quot;Love In Action.&quot;  It's also -funny- here and there...What may also surprise you is the lighting -- there is greater variation in the lighting than I've seen in the Utopia DVD's currently available.With this old show finally available on DVD, can &quot;An Evening With Utopia&quot; be far behind?
460, I've been on board since season one.  The writing is just not as good as the early seasons.  The commentary and the extras are the only thing that saved this set for me.  The commentary was better than that jokes in the episodes.  I don't know how much longer this is going to last. If this is the last season, and Comedy Central doen't renew, They  went out on a good note.  If you can put up with less laughs and just watcing the characters on screen, it's a so so set that is passable.
461, I received this unit as a promotion special when I bought an iCarrier. Some observations I have made while putting this unit through its paces.Pros:Will charge your smartphone at least two times overAuto-shut off - Once device is full, unit shuts off to conserve batterybuit-in flashlight and laser pointerFour LED lights to indicate battery statusSlim enought to fit in your pocketCons:Plastic body constuction - will probably crack if droppedNot enough juice to charge power hungry tablets to fullOne button - Accidently keep on turning on the laser pointer when meaning to turn the unit on/offThis would be five stars if they were able to multiple buttons to control the device, flashlight and laser pointer.  Also, they could increase the capacity to 7000+mAh.  All in all, solid product.
462, This is a fairly simple game. Get the ninja who is jumping from two buildings as high as you can while evading obstacles such as birds flying down, squirrels on clothing lines and other ninjas. When you collect 3 of a kind, like 3 birds or sqirrels, you can get a power jump. I think that it is an okay game to play. I would rate it as average in my opinion. I would still recommend this app to any gaming fans or anyone looking to fill their devices with games.
463, I have tried the 5% and the 10% version of this bar and I would say that it is pretty effective to a degree.  The most I can use this bar is once a day every other day in the colder months and once a day every day in warmer months.  I would describe my skin as sensitive but it is not extremely sensitive like some folks I know.  I have to make sure that I rinse very well so it doesn't bleach my sheets or clothes and follow up with a good moisturizer, depending on the weather.
464, This stuff can save the day when you have a flat. I dont want to spend time at the side of the road, and I dont like hearing in the news of people dying being hit by cars when trying to change a tire. I dont care how good you are at doing it, its going to take some time, and time is not on your side when texting drivers are passing by you at seventy mph.I just squirt some in and use my portable tire inflator to get me home or to a tire shop and deal with it there. Easy to connect and just squeeze.This is cheap insurance
465, Didn't realize it didn't come with the wiring harness and instead must cut and splice to the original wiring. But there is no way a normal human being can undo the harness anyway. It's behind the manifold where you can barely reach with one hand from the top. There is no way possible to reach it from underneath unless you start unbolting some suspension parts. So I guess this cut and splice model was the way to go. The bad part is you have to do all the splicing while under the car.I haven't installed it yet because the instructions are sort of unclear as to the correct color of the wires.
466, I waited and waited for this book to finally come! Thankfully I have it on Kindle, because toting these thick paperbacks around is not fun. Well this book was worth the wait! Jon is the Lord Commander, Dany is Queen of Meeren and Tyrion embarks on another adventure with a long lost Targaryen in disguise. At least Cersei gets her just punishment by the Faith of the Seven.Reader, please read this book very carefully. There are a lot of details that is important to the plot of the character's backstory and who will ultimately sit on the Iron Throne.  Martin tells a lot of riddles and it takes some time to figure them out.  I have started to reread all of the books and have picked up details missed in the first run.Martin is a truly gifted writer with an incredible imagination. I will be sad when this series comes to an end, but it's been an incredible journey!
467, We like Avent brand nipples bc they are durable and not overly flexible. My son is teething and these nipples hold up well amidst his chewing/gumming. Nipples are not as flexible as other brands (Playtex for example) which helps against excess dripping when my son wolfs his formula down. These do seem to be a slightly slower flow than other medium level nipples however. We have &#34;up sized&#34; Avent nipples quicker than other brands. These nipples also seem to work well w my son's reflux. Will continue to purchase.
468, My Nordic background blessed (?) me with blond hair, light skin, and sensitivities/allergies to a lot of different things.  One of my biggest problems moving to Florida 33 years ago was to find an EFFECTIVE deodorant and anti-perspirant  that didn't declare war on my underarms.  Everything I tried made my underarms sore and chaffed.Several products I tried professed to be 'gentle' and 'hypoallergenic' and yet caused the same reaction.  Finally I tried Almay and was amazed that not only did it work in Southwest Florida's heat and humidity, but I had no adverse reactions to it.  Another advantage is that it doesn't mark my clothes like some deodorants do.So if you are having a problem finding an effective deodorant/anti-perspirant that doesn't cause a problem with your skin, give Almay a try.  Hopefully it will solve your problem too.
469, I've ordered Bandolino's in the past and always had a good fit (size 10).  In fact, the day I ordered these Mylah's I also ordered the Bandolino Capture pumps[[ASIN:B00B5NSRLU Bandolino Women's Capture FB Platform Pump].  The Bandolino Capture's fit great, but the Mylah style was to tight across the toes and very tight over the top of my foot.  These shoes just run small. I ordered the Gold and I did like the style and color, just wish they fit correctly.
470, So i got this album by chance from downloading a huge new jack swing packet. I thought to myself,who's johnny gill? I've heard of sweat,levert,gill, bobby brown, and new edition, but It always seemed to me that most people seemed to forget about his music. Johnny's gill's 1991 album is amazing. It's got slick beats and excellent vocals to back it up. Since michael jackson just died recently, alot of people proclaimed his dangerous album to be the greatest new jack swing album, i strongly disagree I think Johnny Gill's is just as excellent of an album. Fairweather friend is great, rub the right way is one of my favorite title tracks, and I also love my,my,my. It's great dance music, and the beats are interesting to listen to. If your into r&b this album is a must have!
471, This case has been wonderful! It was tight at first because I have a plastic case around my phone to protect the phone in case I drop it.  After a week or so the case has loosened up just right. I like the opening at the bottom because it allows me to push the phone out easier. I love the extra pocket too. If I don't want to take my purse I can slip in a credit card and my driver's license and they are under the flap and the pocket has snaps for extra security. The clip is REALLY tight too so it won't slip off of anything unless you take it off. I would buy it again! The service was wonderful too!
472, what can I say about Stevie WOnder that hasn't already been said?? Musical Genius and trensetter along with creating a style and vibe all his own. this DOuble Album is the kind of album which reflects a wide range of topics  from everyday life and Love and everything else in between and a Musical Blend of Stews that sizzle from start to finish.  "As" is always the song that moves as does "isn't she lovely", Another Star, knocks me off my feet, I wish, sir duke,etc... so many great songs, stylings and Production that still blows the mind some 30 plus years later. incredible Music from an Incredible Musical Genius.
473, These Tees were a bargain.  so I took a chance.  They are red, red as red should be.They are 4XL-, just a wee tighter that I would like - easy fix, before I put them on, run my arms through the sleeves, and stretch the shirt wider.  Works every time.Fabric is soft and non irritating.  Color seems to be holding after about 4 washings.Quality seems above average - only thought here, I wish the fabric was slightly thicker.  But this is a real picky comment.Overall the shirt is good quality, especially considering the price.These are very easy to recomend.
474, This is your basic British kidnapping gone awry with expected twists. (OH THOSE BRITS!) The entire cast consisted of three people and a guy at the other end of a phone. Two bad guys go to great efforts to kidnap a young woman and not get caught. Their plan is well thought out. They seem like professionals until the human factor enters into the equation and Gemma doesn't play by the rules. Good crime thriller, well written and acted.PARENTAL GUIDE: F-bombs, nudity (Gemma Arterton) plus some male nudity. Sexual themes.
475, This is an excellent program. You write in what you ate. Then there is a list of foods to select from that have the calorie and nutritioninformation on the food. You can state how much you want to lose a week and it will give you the amount of calories you need to maintainto keep your goal. Other parts of the program tell  you what you will weigh in five weeks if you keep taking in  your current calorie amount.This is the best of these types of programs I have seen. It provides all the nutrition information you could possibly need. My husband is on a low salt diet and this program makes it easy for him to get a record of how much sodium he has taken in in a day, week, whatever.
476, This is an interesting and relatively well developed drama series.  While I'm sure the show attempts to do their best at giving a somewhat scientifically-based look into the art of interpreting human behavior, gestures, body language and the ability to detect lying - you have to realize most of the show is fictional in nature designed to support the drama plot.  Nevertheless, the acting is good (although the lead character is difficult to watch initially - until you settle in to the peculiarities of his behavior) - and the story lines are believable and well planned.  Well worth the watch.
477, These filters are great! I have read about how much research and development that has gone into them. I have total peace of mind knowing that this baby will remove any nasties that might get into my engine oil. The funny thing is, Ordering this filter and having it shipped from the United States to my home address in Australia is actually cheaper than ordering it from the cheapest store here 5 minutes drive down the road, (currently Autobarn). I save about $2, and all the fuss of going out of my way to get it :)Always happy to buy a K&N; oil filter every 10,000kms.
478, I've had a few Battery tender juniors for a years and they work great. It was just never convenient to leave them charging all the time with the little box just laying on the floor.Now that I have a reason to have four chargers, I sprung for this big boy. It is worth the extra money just to have a centrally located charging station and be able to look at a glance to see the status of each battery.This comes with four battery terminal/fuse harnesses and four alligator clip harnesses, but buy an extension if you need more than 6 feet of length.
479, I love the 60 second instant heat-up & that it has 30 temperature settings. At first, I had a little problem with a ridge from the clip, but with some practice I was able to adjust the angle of the iron in order to eliminate that. Now, I get nice smooth curls.The only real problem I can see is that the heat setting dial is in a bad location. With every curl, my thumb would accidentally change the dial. I had to make sure, after each curl, to check the number on the dial. That's not so hard to do for the price!
480, An absolute amazing entry into the Jack Ryan universe. This novel provides the back story of the mysterious character of John Kelly A.K.A. Mr. Clark. The events take you on a two fold journey. One a revenge trip John takes on the local pimps and drug dealers who attacked him and killed his girl. While doing this he also plans and executes a Special Ops mission into Vietnam to rescue an American P.O.W. The action is intense and keeps moving at a steady pace through out. If you are new to Tom Clancy, this book is a great place to start.
481, A good mascara for everyday use, but not what I choose for a dramatic look. Looks great and lasts all day when used over a lash conditioner (to thicken and lengthen) after lashes have been curled. This is one of the darkest black formulas I've ever used, and it looks great. It's a long lasting formula with minimal clumping and no flaking. The only thing I hate about it is that if it gets in my eyes while washing off, it BURNS so bad! Same if I cry while wearing it! Loreal and Rimmel mascaras do the same thing, but not as bad. This mascara burns more than any other I have tried.
482, I did enjoy this series. I do not know why it only went one season, but I gather it did.The production quality is very good with some very high quality cinematography and some appropriate understated acting. It starts slow, so I recommend you stick it out for 3 or so episodes before giving it up. It was worth it for me.However, the 3 stars is due to the abruptness in ending what promised to be a good plot. The very end left me a little cold and was obviously a setup for another season.I do not regret watching this season of Rubicon, but I wanted more at the end.
483, I loved a wallet I had bought a few years back but the zipper for closing it broke. So I spent quite a bit of time looking for another one similar to it, to no avail.  When I decided to look on Amazon, I  chose this one  because it met my 'checklist' for what I needed in a wallet - enough 'slots' for credit cards, a visible place for my ID, a full size compartment to put bills in, and a place for coins. Furthermore, it's really a nice looking wallet for the price. Time will tell how long it will last!
484, I have spent a great deal of money on tights recently, and these are by far the best.  They don't run, rip or snag if you handle them properly. They look good. I wear them in place of stockings with business clothes and they look good, feel good. There is some compression so it's a nice supportive feel and slenderizing.  The nude really is a nude color. Pink is nice with pink shoes. I will be buying more now that I know they work. LIght weight enough for warm weather.
485, Joe and the bots are put through a grueling ordeal w/ LOST CONTINENT. They hang on for dear life during the interminably-long "mountain climbing" sequence that consumes nearly half the movie's running time w/ climbing... Climbing... CLIMBING! A dinosaur (aka: a tiny lizard filmed from below) is glimpsed, but even it leaves out of boredom. Finally, a stop-motion brontosaurus lumbers forth, only to be filled w/ lead! So little action takes place, that Joel nearly lapses into a coma! Luckily, through the wonders of MST3K technology, this film is rendered (nearly) harmless. Let us thank these brave lads...
486, I think this is the album that gave Stevie Wonder the reputation that he had a really sophisticated R&B sound and that his music was really deep... and the album speaks worlds beyond this but I think that it really is a testament to Wonder that it is appreciated by so many different musicians alike (be it classical, jazz, or pop or all of the above) This album has the moog and electronic feel but it's so powerful at the same time... by far... some of the best tracking you will ever hear on an album..
487, I am watching it now and really enjoying it. Canadian show from the Sci=Fi channel That was recommended to me. After the first 8 shows, I ordered the second season. Like Murder She Wrote, this is set in a small town in main. Here at least there are some reasons given for all that is going on from the long term point of view. Cabot Cove just seemed to heve to many people being murdered each episode. The show started to take place elsewhere after awhile wich was a good move to keep the show moving forward.
488, Now this is a greatest hits collection.I'll always remember seeing Diana  Ross in Vegas,and  Diana's on a screen singing,&quot;Ain't no mountain  hight enough.&quot;Then all of a sudden,she's walking down these long white  steps,and  comes right out of the screen.The audience went wild.During the  concert,Diana has everyone hold each others hand singing,&quot;Reach out  and touch,somebody's hand.&quot; This was a huge hit for the singer.I  remember going to church one Sunday when this song came out.The Priest  mentioned this wonderfull new record during Mass,about helping others  .&quot;Love Hangover,&quot; is one of my favorite songs.On my web-site,its  on my top 25 hits of all time.From all the Disco records to come from the  70's,this one's a classic. I'm so glad &quot;Upside down,&quot; and  &quot;I'm coming out&quot; is on this CD also.Your going to love this  collection of Diana's greatest hits.
489, Gloria Vanderbilt &#34;Amanda&#34; jeans have been my favorite for a very long time.  I've recently lost some weight and instead of women's sizes am now in misses sizes. I wondered if that would make a difference, but I'm still satisfied with the sizing and fit. It's nice to know you can order a style and size and be reasonably sure of satisfaction.  I do so dislike having to return items. They also are of good quality.  In the past, I've had Amanda jeans for years, laundering them about once a week.  They really wear well and last.
490, I downloaded this while in nutrition class and started tracking because I wanted to lose weight.  Almost everything you can possibly imagine is already in the library and you can add your own if it isn't.  It is a great motivator to leave certain things alone when you know exactly what you have already taken in for the day and when you know exactly what you are about to take in.  It is also nice to be able to look and see &#34;oh, I've still got 1000 cals left for today so, yes, I think I will have those cookies.&#34;  Making informed decisions lead to results.  I've lost 23 pounds in 8 weeks and this has been a big help along the way.
491, I continue to think that Clancy is a quality author and I will read anything he (not the team) writes.  This is no exception.  I really liked the development of "Mr. Clark", he is now the standard for the anti hero.  The story was also another good one, our hero saying enough is enough and putting his foot down.  You get everything you expect from one of his books, great characters with a lot of development, a strong story line, many sub plots that come together in the end and details - lots of details about weapons, tactics and anything else guys like to talk or read about.  I felt like going out and kicking a little drug dealer butt myself after finishing the book.
492, I purchased these to slide behind the rear tires of my mower when I use a mower lifter to raise the mower front. As the production description indicates you get two chocks for a low price. They are light in weight and  stack together for storage. I use a MoJack mower lifter and the manual recommends the use of wheel chocks. Even without that recommendation I use these chocks because the cost of around five bucks is a small price to pay for added safety when doing dangerous work such as getting under a lifted lawn mower. As the old expression goes "better safe than sorry".
493, I don't own this product, and from the reviews posted, I won't ever own it.  I do, however, own the VHS version that was released in 1987.  It was an official Apple release, and the quality is superb, both picture quality and sound quality.  Fans please note that the songs that are in the movie have entirely different audio mixes than the mixes that appeared on the MMT album.  So Magical Mystery Tour, Fool On the Hill, Flying, Blue Jay Way, Your Mother Should Know and I Am The Walrus all have unique mixes on the soundtrack that you can't find anywhere else, and on the VHS tape these mixes sound really great in VHS Hi-Fi (gosh, remember that?) IMO, these mixes blow the "regular" mixes of these songs away.The tape is still easy to find and reasonably priced.  Again, its quality is superb and I'm sure puts this DVD to shame.
494, I LOVE this tub! The moulded shapes hold my baby nicely and allow me to have my hands free to bathe him properly. We have been using it since he was three weeks old and it still works well. We always lay a towel in the bottom to keep him from slipping around and for comfort. The drain on the side is a nice convenience and makes emptying it easy. The only issue is it's size, but we found that it fits perfectly under the crib and we store all of the baby toys, towels and baby bath products inside.
495, This album is one of the best that Diana has ever recorded.  I am still at a loss as to why this CD did not generate any hit singles, because there were possibilites galore.  From the beat of the title track, to the  tenderness of &quot;I Thought That We Were Still in Love&quot;, to the  emotional &quot;Voice of the Heart&quot;, this album takes you through so  many stages of feeling.  Practically ignored by the radio industry, this  album has the power to truly lift one's spirits.  It is certainly named  appropriately.  If only Motown had promoted it properly, more people would  have had the opportunity to enjoy its richness.
496, I am still in the process of removing the old steering stabilizer and will give more product review after installing the new Monroe Stabilizer. I feel confident that I will be satisfied since it is an old and trusted name product. Check back for an update after my installation is finished and I have road tested the XJ steering ability.Update: After much heavy duty persuasion, the old steering stabilizer gave way to my determination and popped out with the help of a good pitman arm puller tool. Installing the new one was a breeze and, after roads testing the Xj, I must say that I am well pleased with the improvement in the handling of my Jeep. After 6 years and almost 200,000 miles, this Monroe steering stabilizer has brought back the original feel of handling on the road that she had in her younger days. I would definitely recommend this item to anyone.
497, fantastic camera app, works perfectly on galaxy tab 7, front and rear camera take great pics, i like all the settings that are available, i emailed myself a few of the strips i took and they look great printed out, ive even had people ask me where i got them at, they didnt believe i took them with my tab. definatly an app i use alot, its a nice way to get some good pics of my son cause he never sits still for me to take a pic, now i can just catch him off guard. overall a fantastic app.
498, I had difficult skin for many years before trying jojoba oil. This stuff is absolutely amazing, year round. Perfect for summer, winter, and every day. It's light, non-greasy, and leaves my skin feeling fresh and moist without any residue. I use it every day after I shower and it's the only thing that doesn't make me break out. It's also remarkably inexpensive, long-lasting, scentless, and natural. Highly recommended for anyone with skin issues or as a general purpose moisturizer for those with healthy skin.
499, I overdid with salicylic acid, and my chin was super dry. I grab small bottle of this oil at Trader Joe`s, used 3 times today, and my skin came back to normal! Blemishes are less visible by far, and my skin is not dry. It`s amazing how fast that works! I was afraid of the smell, but it`s not bad (herbs and menthol). It`s also great with cuts and wounds. I was never interested in essential oils, but I googled the stuff and I`m gonna try the other ones too (like lavender for sleep and relaxation).Do not hesitate!Added later: please dilute this, because I use it in full strength few times a day and I burnt my skin, it was really red and patchy for few days. It all went away, but this is strong oil, and I highly recommend to dilute with water.
500, I have been making small strides in my workout program. But there was still a few aspects that I needed to cover. I am lousy at logging my caloric intake. This app not only makes it easy, but actually helps me plan what I will or will not eat. Also, it lets me know when I am NOT EATING ENOUGH. For somebody like me who is a bit OCD (understatement) this allows me to micro manage to my little heart's content. Even better, I was able to show my wife and she has this app on her phone now.
501, These are a must in humid climates. I ordered some long sleeve ones too. There are lots of pockets on the chest so it &#34;looks&#34; very much so like a fishing shirt. If that is okay, then you are fine.  Columbia makes some others that have less or different pocket style.  My Tamiami II long sleeve one has better pocket designs.  Color is a big factor in cost which is weird, but price can vary as much as $10-12 per shirt based on color despite Amazon being the seller.
502, Fits my 1994 Dodge Ram pickup that has the 318 motor.  Grew weary of the cheaper (orange) filters made of such thin metal you can fold the case with your bare hand, let alone an oil filter wrench.  As I don't put many miles on the truck these days, I change oil and filter annually, not on mileage.  Though these filters are more expensive, it is cheap insurance, and oil changes are much easier now.  All you need is a ratchet and 1" socket.  Glad Amazon stocks these at a reasonable price.  I use K&N oil filters exclusively now.
503, Whether you are a lover of psychological thrillers or just gritty action packed ones Luther provides enough for both. The character is the epitome of HUMAN and SUPERHUMAN in the same breath. I've not seen a show in a long time that portrays all the cracks and faults of being a human being and yet show the strength and conviction of a super hero in one person.You love him and hate him at times but you root for him every time. Villains are multi-faceted as well. Season 3 won't arrive fast enough.
504, The hands-freeness of this gate makes me so happy. I can walk through it with a baby in my arms and other junk in my hands, and I don't have any trouble getting it open. The foot pedal requires a lot of pressure, so my five year old has a hard time getting in and out, but that is okay because sometimes I want to keep her out of the kitchen, too! The installation was a breeze, and the gate has not moved a millimeter since I put it up despite being pulled on by both the baby and the five year-old. And what pleases me most is that I cannot find a place anywhere on the gate for fingers to be pinched at any stage of being open, closed or closing. We are using one extension with this gate. The measurements of it (the gate) and what space it will fit (with/without extensions) is accurate too.
505, I had this product for 2 weeks now. I loved the packaging and the way the product is placed inside.I had a smile on my face when I was using this device because not only do I have a portable external battery, it also has a built in laser and Led light. (which are like the three things I always use and having them all in one device is a plus.) It is also very affordable.Pros:-light weight-has a high capacity for its size-slim profile and comes with a protective pouch.-I like the double press laser activation (kids have been chasing the red dot like cats :D)Cons:-I think the activation of the led light could have been better.-It would charge higher capacity devices slower, but then again maybe its because other devices have a high capacity storage.For its price, its doing a great job and my sister loves it too.
506, This worked great! I had not cut my 5 year old nails in at least 2 years as he would eat them down to nothing. He stopped biting his nails after the first time we used it. I put in on every few days and after just 3 weeks, he stopped bitting his nails all together, even if I skip using the product for several days. Last night I had to cut his nails for the very fist time since he was 3! It does smell terrible when you first put it on but as soon as it dries (a couple of minutes), the smell is gone.
507, this is a fantastic app!! i have lost 10 pounds by monitoring my exercise and what i eat.  its not a diet..it just helps you make better decisions about type and quantity of food you eat. i have not given up any foods except those really not very healthy for me to eat.. i just manage my portions.  And I exercise more regularly because i have to log that, as well.  great app...great results!! i am at my goal weight in 3 months!!
508, I'm a bit disappointed in how low of a maintenance voltage it keeps.  This is likely intentional so the charger does not 'cook' the electrolyte.I needed a charger to replace the one I used to use in combination with my desulfator (a home built one, though not by me), and desulfators thrive when there is a tiny bit over overcurrent.Others mention the fan, and yeah, you can hear this one.  While I have a bit of concern that'll be the first item to fail, it should be simple to replace for almost no cost.
509, Taking place during the later stages of vietnam, this book has everything. Action, love, murder, revenge, personal agenda, hardships, success and failures from the every average day doctor to your admorals. An ex navy seal, who loses his wife and girlfriends, turns into a cold blooded killing machine that once stops, won't quit until his mission is a success. It helps to define Mr Clark and sets up his character for later in the Jack Ryan books. You also have other losses from killings to perosnal agenda for wanting the war to end peaccfully, to getting people out of enemy territory. So if you want action, drama, romance, it is all here in this book and then some. DOn't pass up on this book, you will reget it!
510, I agree with the other reviewer that this is the best Giselle I have ever seen. The second act, one of the peaks of European culture, is perfection in this version: bathed in moonlight, the young maidens dead before marriage, dance a surreal accompaniment to the tragic love affair of the two principals. The whole hallucinatory effect is supported by the marvelous music of Adolphe Adam: the quintessence of banality. the acme of vacuity, but perfection in this context. An experience to view and review time and again. Utterly divine. I want to givbe it five stars but the Amazon site is defective on my computer and will only accept one for some reason.
511, We brought these nipples based on all the raving reviews and write up's online.  However our newborn is now here and wasn't putting on enough weight.  Our pediatrician told us these are the worse brand of bottles on the market for newborns and shouldn't be used until the baby is at least 5 months old.  The reason for this is because the nipple is too large for a newborn to latch on to and they're unable to get enough.  We are now using the Medela nipples instead and he's feeding so much better.
512, I started to break out in a rash under my arms. HUH ? So, I tried letting it all clear up, but every time I used an anti-perspirant again... BLAM ! IT WAS BACK. I eat a lot of veggies and herbs. I really can't do without an anti-perspirant. Deodorants only mix with the odor and get more potent during the workday. I was DESPARATE. Almay is THE answer. No more rash, no more odor. Whew. The things we take for granted until something changes. Thanks, Almay
513, This was a great series with good acting and true to the time period. London Hospital was ahead of it's time as far as treating the sick and injured. It was fascinating to see how people were treated and that the hospital opened at 8am with patients lined up at the gate. London Hospital pioneered new treatments and procedures while treating the poor. I loved that they smoked in the operating rooms while working on patients as the patients drank a cup of tea!  If you like history and medicine you should watch this series.
514, Hi All,Not much that can be said about a snow brush...but I will tell you that this is a great product.  The northeast, while not being hammered with blizzards, has been getting hit with a lot of small nuisance type snow/ice storms.  I got tired of our older brush...and one day while sitting in (snow day) I decided to hunt a new one down on Amazon.  $3.58 with free shipping and not an ounce wasted in gasoline.....  What more do I need to say?I love the cushioned grip with cut outs to wrap your fingers around it perfectly.  The ice scraper works great and so far had held up to 3 cars - for 3 scrapings.Excellent product in my opinion and a great value to boot.
515, After putting on the lift kit, Skyjacker shocks and bigger tires the Jeep definitely drove differently.  Has 170k miles on it and decided I might as well swap out the steering stabilizer as well.  Don't do a ton of off-road but enough that I figured it was time to change it out.  Noticed a huge difference immediately.  Steering feels much firmer, not tight, but firm and controlled.  Steering response also feels better, not as much "wiggle" so to speak when making turns of hitting big pot holes.  Overall very glad I purchased it.  Great product.  Rancho has always had a great reputation and now I can definitely see why.One thing to note.  The body is not as "white" as it appears in the picture.  It is more of a medium grey color.  No biggie but thought it was worth mentioning.
516, I had one for a long trip to Israel.  Held my small camera, sunglasses, a few shekels, energy pills, and a bunch of small misc.  Darn if I didn't give it away 6 months after we returned home.  Tried other over the shoulder small bags but I missed this one for it's rugged look, perfect size and comfortable carrying.  Being made of canvas you can won't mind tossing it around or getting it dirty.  And, it is manly!  Send me another!
517, Signed, Sealed &amp; Delivered is a great album from Stevie Wonder.  The title track is among his most popular with its ringing guitars, blazing horns, southern fried sound and fiery vocals it is a r&amp;b classic. Many of the songs point towards his movement into more social and political commentary. His cover of the Beatles' &quot;We Can Work It Out&quot; turns it from a song about a love relationship into a song about racial unity.  &quot;Never Had A Dream Come True&quot; is another song about inequality.  The album's most moving and emotional song is &quot;Heaven Help Us&quot;.  The song has a powerful orchestral movement and is a plea for change.  The album showed a more mature artist and is a forerunner of the work he would explore later in the decade.
518, For the sake of people who are probably new to Twitter, I'm not going to get into gory details about this app. Suffice it to say, if you're looking for the best Twitter app for the Kindle Fire (the only platform I've used it on) this is the one. I tried the Twitter app (just a link to the mobile website) and a few others and this app is easy to use, works seamlessly with Facebook, and is easy to customize. Not sure what the paid version gets you (other than no ads) but the ads aren't intrusive and it works reliably for everything I need.
519, Characters come and go, and the only characters I still care about are the Starks, of many of whom there seems to be almost no word in the last two books. I thought the third book was starting to slow down, the fourth one was just a lot of padding, and the fifth one is trying to get started again. Better than the previous one, too many words that get nowhere, still an interesting read. Let's hope the next installment will come faster than the five years it took to get this one done.
520, I love these things.  I can only give them four stars though.  Occassionally I have slid while wearing them.  I like to walk to work and I live in Wisconsin.  Well getting to work in the winter isn't too bad, there is enough sunlight to see where the ice is.  Walking home on the other hand it is dark.  However, I do not have to give up walking in the winter because I'm afraid of getting hurt.  I strap these bad boys on hold my head up and walk with confidence.  The cleats really are great, they are super easy to replace and they last a long time.  Let's see I walk 2.6 miles a day, 5 days a week and the cleats will last me about 4 months.  Of course that means I change them about once a year.I have taken these hiking as well and I like them for trails that have become compacted ice and trails that are along water and are slippery.
521, Funny what you don't know will cause a problem when you're a first time RV'er.  My dog's toenail got painfully stuck when she was climbing the steps up into the travel trailer. They're not particularly long but she's a big dog and got one somehow caught in those little holes in the step. I assume those holes are there for drainage or something.  Anyway I bought two of these in blue, put them on lickety split and there's been no problem since...convincing the dog the steps were safe to use again took more time!
522, I purchased this as a diaper bag to use for my daughter and new son.  The front pockets are ideal for diapers and the side pockets can hold all manner of things you need to carry around for a 3 year old and a newborn.  The inner pocket is huge and perfect for toys and a wallet so you don't have to carry a diaper bag and a purse.  The material is very strong, I look forward to actually being able to use this bag for a long time and even after I don't need it as a diaper bag anymore.  The price is perfect considering I've owned $20 bags that are meant to be diaper bags and they just fall apart on you after a couple of months, I don't see that happening with this one and on another plus side it is unisex so my husband won't feel silly wearing it.  The color is nice also. Very happy with my purchase.
523, Although I do not have the Simmons changing pad, mine is the same measurement but the cover doesn't fit.  I am giving it 4 stars though, because if it did fit, it would be a good changing pad cover.  It is absorbant for times when you are mid diaper and there is an accident, and is much more comfortable than the plastic on the pad.  It wears up well to washing, and comes in many colors to match nearly any nursery.  If you do not have the Simmons changing pad, do not get this product, but if you do, this is a great product to have.
524, A perennial favourite of the chattering classes, I purchased this hoping for some high quality soul music of a similar style to the excellent Lighthouse Family - sadly there is no comparison. Firstly there are only 9 songs compared to a whopping 17 on the Very Best of the Lighthouse Family, so it's easy to see where to go for value for money. Secondly, Mr Gayes' anti war sentiments seem somewhat nave and foolish in today's political climate. Thirdly, Mr Gaye can't sing and has to resort to shock tactics such as singing in a high voice like a lady in order to sell records. No wonder his career ground to a halt in the early 80's! Verdict: avoid.
525, We bought 3 originally and when one was washed it had a hole in it instantly and I could see why.  These are not the most durable covers made.  So, we bought cradle size lap pads and keep one over the cover.  It works wonderfully and is easy to pick up and put in the hamper if it gets dirty.  Plus, they are cheaper.  So, we have the nice clean look of a white cover and put the lap pad over top of it.  Works great!
526, The unit is very nice looking out of the box, but the case seems to get scuffed / scratched very easily after some time in my backpack. I really like the small, compact, size of this device.  Even with the small size, this pack still charges my iPhone 5 well over two times - that's the main purpose, so you can't complain.  It's the most portable New Trent device that I own.  The on/off power button seems to stick a bit when you try to power the device on.  It will usually turn on the second attempt.  Would it be possible to improve this switch to allow it to slide back and forth?  I would rate this device a 4.5 out of 5, and the only complain being the power button.  This provides an excellent amount of power for $40.
527, You have to really want to understand this movie if you are to appreciate it. You should be familiar with Zappa's work and be prepared to watch it many times and maybe even do a little research to help figure out some of  the inside jokes and other craziness. Actually makes sense if you  understand it. A testament to Zappa's greatness. The editing job on this  one must have taken ages! MAGIC FINGERS is one of Zappa's best melodies,  and the performances are unforgettable. If you love Zappa, try this one if  you got the time.
528, All Eyez On Me is a fly album, but it's not as good as Tupac's first three albums. Compared to his masterpiece, Me Against The World, this is not that good. It still contains some gems though. We got classic cuts like  &quot;California Love&quot;, &quot;I Ain't Mad At Cha&quot; and &quot;Got  My Mind Made Up&quot; (an ill possecut with Redman, Method Man and Tha Dogg  Pound), but then again we also have boring songs like &quot;No More  Pain&quot; and the horrible &quot;Check Out Time&quot;.So, if you  haven't got any of Tupac's albums, I recommend you buy Me Against The  World, Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z or 2Pacalypse Now before you buy All Eyez  On Me. If you already have those albums, then you should look in the  bargain basket for this album. It's not really worth full price.
529, The story was engaging and thought provoking.  There were some really nice key storylines with some good backing threads, that because it was cancelled after only 1 season, could have been finished better.  The story did end at a VERY pivotal plot point, I am assuming, to be paid off discussed the next season, which never happened.As long as you are ok with having on major climax without the release of much falling action afterwards, I do suggest the watch.  I remember my youth reading many books that ended right at the point that i wanted them to keep on going, if you like that feeling of &#34;well what is going to happen now?!?!?&#34; you will love this show.
530, I first began watching SGU on Netflix and watched both seasons. Since Netflix sometimes doesn't have the following season I did an online search and to my dismay found that SGU had been cancelled.SGU was something different and apart from the other science fiction series and I really liked how each chapter incorporated parts from the previous chapters.Perhaps its plot was too complex for the average viewer or there wasn't enough sex or strong language or perhaps not enough people shooting guns and blowing things up.Whatever the reason, it was a poor choice because season 2, in my mind, was just opening up to all that SGU was about and I will always wonder how the final cliff hanger would have played out.
531, I own close to almost everything that Pink Floyd has ever put out. Wheather it be tapes, CD's, books. This video is the gem of my entire collection. I have two of them actually. The one shown here is the older version. That one doesn't have color on it anymore because I've watched it so much that the tape is thin. Just great stuff if your a Floyd fan. &quot;Careful with that axe, Eugene.&quot; Classic!! The scream that Roger lets out is unreal. &quot;Echos&quot; is also unbelievable. Sound wise you can get better on such an old tape. It sounds Raw, but that's a good thing. It has a lot of good little moments with the Floydsters in the studio during the &quot;Darkside of the moon&quot; sesions. AWESOME!
532, I absolutely love this show! Took me 4 years to finally give this gem a try, and once I started watching it...I couldn't stop! Pretty Little Liars: Season 1 is highly addicting. But to tell you the truth, every season I've watched so far has been amazing. The cast is incredibly talented, the writing is clever, and the plot is well-crafted. So join Spencer, Aria, Hanna, and Emily as the they try to discover who &#34;A&#34; really is, and why he or she wants to mess with their them. Secrets have a way of coming out as you know. My first impression of this show was so dead wrong. It's not predictable, fluffy, or insipid...it's insanely entertaining! Buy season 1 today. You won't be disappointed. Enjoy.
533, Works great. Fairly easy swap. Just be aware: The front window regulators are the same on whether you have a Suburban or Tahoe or one of their GM family members. Not so for the rear regulators. The full size SUVs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones. The vehicle input feature Amazon provides does not know this and will lead you to purchase the wrong ones if you are not aware of the difference. The pictures will reveal which you need if you have the old one to look at, but the vehicle ID feature will allow you to buy either and tell you it will fit. BEWARE!!!! Just so you know, the Dorman 741-578 and 741-579 fit the full size and the 748-228 and 748-229 fit the Tahoe size vehicles.
534, This album is a very underrated and very good effort by a band that in the late 80 s was part of a massive arrival of new bands into the music market in North America and the rest of the world.I remember another good band that impressed me at that time and was Nuclear assault.  Brilliant musicians.Anyhow, this album is a very good follow up to Punishment for decadence which is a masterpiece.  In No more color, the band further explores and deepens their yet excellent heavy sound.Objectively speaking, the brilliance in this album comes in side two.  I say this because I purchased the vynil back in 1989 or 90.  Mistress of Deception, Tunnel of pain and Last entertainment are musical heaven.  And that s what most of us look for  = )
535, The monsters in this movie are just to add conflict to the film. It's really about two people, and man and a woman, who meet accidently, and must travel from mexico to the U.S. through an infected zone. Of course, through all this danger and stress, they get to know and trust each other, and fall in love.At the beginning of the movie, you think of the monsters as "bad", but as you watch the film, you realize, that's it's just nature taking it's course. Even if they are alien.There is something in this movie for both him and her. (well, if you drama / love films).
536, This game app brings you more than just the game of Sudoku.  It also brings a simple and easy to use system for keeping track of your working solutions in the game.  Before I played this app, I hated everything related to Sudoku.  Sudoku once was nothing more than writing down numbers, scratching them out, rewriting stuff and re-editing your options until you had a massive mess on a 9 x 9 grid.  Not anymore.  I now place Sudoku at the top of my logic puzzle preferences.I personally see no need to upgrade to the paid version, but that ad is annoying and changes frequently making it even more of distraction.I use a Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and this app worked with no problems.
537, I always wanted a Stevie Wonder album growing up, I would always hear his music in movies and everybody always had good things to say about his albums so as I got olders I had to do Research on Mr. Wonder and what I found out was astonishing the man has over 20 Grammy Awards, Classic Albums, Talented Musician, Great Voice to go along with it but there is one album during his Classic Period I find very addicting and that is Songs In The Key Of Life to make a long story short you will never really have to hit the skip button, this truly is his best album of his career but enough talk go and buy it U will be Amazed.
538, Helen Mirren was especially good in this series.  She is elevated to the position of lead detective after the death of the former.  She is the first female to hold this position and is not accepted as competent to lead by the squad.  She proves them wrong after working the case and solving the murders.This is a show that women will love.  It proves that given a chance. they are as competent as the men and very devoted to getting the job done.The acting is especially good and the suspense builds throughout the episodes.
539, This thing will mess up your water coolant pump. For some reason due to the additives it has, it corrodes aluminum parts. I had to replace mu thermostat and water pump on my 2012 Jeep Grand Cherokee. Royal Purple claim that this additive is compatible with all coolants including Mopar, GMC...etc. I don't think so. Not from what I experienced. I strongly suggest you don't use this product. Plus It did not make any difference in cooling although I had a 180F thermostat. If you are looking for better cooling go other ways such as upgraded radiators or different thermostats rather than this cheap product which can damage your coolant system !
540, I use this tub along with the Safer Bather and absolutely love it.  While on vacation at a friends home I about lost my mind without this tub.  She had another baby tub and my daughter was sliding all over the place.  I have used the Eurobath with the Safer Bather from the start with my baby and she doesn't slide anywhere.  She is now 8 months old and loves to kick and play in the water.  I plan to buy this for my friend when she has her next child.  I think every parent needs a safe tub.
541, I love the look of these shoes and was so hoping the fit would be great...not so. I ordered a (92A) and the left shoe wasso long, couldn't believe it; the right shoe fit great. So I decided to order a 81/2(2A)...just received them. I couldn't believe it--they don't fit either...left shoe still too long & too wide and right shoe doesn't fit--too wide.I have trouble finding narrow shoes that are affordable and attractive so am very disappointed. I'm wondering if there wasa problem in production and therefore were cheaper???
542, I got this as a gift and loved it for the first six months.  Then I discovered what a waste of money it was.  Once solid foods were introduced into my son's diet, this didn't even come close to holding in the stench.  I even used the different types of refills that were made for it...ie. infant, original and toddler.  Still didn't do the trick.  I even put air fresheners in and near it....  Eventually I gave up and took dirty diapers straight out to the garage and only used it for pee diapers.  Still a hassle to remove the "diaper weenie" so now I just use a normal trash can.  Much less hassle and same results.
543, Actually I have this DVD not from Amazon but from other source, so I graded just the quality of the movie, not the quality of the DVD... For those who really love the Beatles, I think you have to get this movie, for it's very interesting to watch the band during Mystery Tour period... probably it's not good at all as a usual movie, but because of that fact that Lennon, McCartney, Harrison and Starr are there makes it interesting. My favorite moment is when they are playing I am the Walrus... which is probably the only time they played this song in front of the cameras... It's a very good piece of history about the Beatles. If you like the album Magical Mystery Tour itself, you will surely enjoy this DVD, without any doubt.
544, Smells exacty like natural lavender, which is spicy and herbal, versus the overly powerful and too-sweet synthetic/artificial lavender most often used in soaps and perfumes.And that's a good thing.Degreases well, for a mostly natural product, and sudses well, too. Yeah, yeah, I know. Ionic surfactants can clean without suds, but let's face it--tons of suds are cool, I like them, I want them, and any product I use to wash my dishes (along with my hands at the same time) needs to have them. Simply put, I won't buy a dish-cleaning product that lacks them.Decently priced for how much you get and how long it lasts, this is also available priced similarly at my local GE Markt Distr store and at my Tarjay.
545, Since the first episode, I fell in love with this show. It has everything to get so popular; a group of great actresses, a great plot and very well written episodes, and i mean it by my title, this is my first TV addiction since The O.C.'s ending in 2007.I just enjoy every episode, because there's drama, mystery and sometimes love in each one, if you buy this season you'll keep watching all the time, I guarantee you.Next season is starting in one week, so i'll watch this DVD in a week just to refresh my mind a little.Just can't wait to watch the Bonus Features, because they seem to be very exciting and interesting, also Amazon is shipping everything so fast, I ordered it last Friday and i'm getting it tomorrow, just keep doing that amazing service that makes you to stand out of all those online stores.
546, We lost our Army Surplus store with some base closings.  I really liked my old regular and hot-weather BDU's from my service time...but these are close.the most annoying part is the little pocket at the knee - when I ride my Harley the wind catches this pocket and makes it a bit irritating as it fights the winds.  The other thing is that they are cut more like loose jeans - which are still not as loose as BDU's - so if you are used to having the freedom of movement that real BDU's offer....you will certainly notice the difference.all  that said, for getting them Prime and inexpensive...they work just fine. At least until I visit a surplus store somewhere in the future.
547, This the perfect app to help you lose weight, you put in what you eat, for each meal. You put each item you eat for eachMeal.  The app will search & find the calories as well as all nutrients.If you exercise you put down calories used. You fill out information,includingAge,height,weight,activity level ,weight loss goal,weight loss /week you want.The app will figure your calories /day to reach your goal  .At the top it will show you calories  needed,calories eaten,& subtract calories used. You are in control ,it shows you exactly what you are doing & let's you see what you needIt also gives you a breakdown of nutrients so you can see if you need to cut down or add.It really gave me a push to start losing & it worked for me..
548, I have to admit that when first reading WITHOUT REMORSE, I wasn't sure that I was going to like it. I thought there was way too much going on in the first chapter and I had a hard time following it. Eventually my perseverance paid off.  I found the book to be a roller-coaster ride full of twists and turns as the plot unfolded. Thus, I concluded that the first chapter was like the long chain beginning the climb on the roller-coaster - very necessary to the overall ride.I do plan on continuing reading more of Tom Clancy's work in addition to reading more Independent Authors.
549, I haven't watched TV since 2007 and only watch DVD's. I have to go by product description (for anything new) and this sounded pretty good. It's not a bad show. Although I could do without the bad language and showing people retching. (That's not entertaining to me and I want to be entertained.)  The main character talks a little too fast so I have to back up the subtitles to see what was said. But overall it isn't too bad a show.  I enjoy the 2 main characters (Jim and the Medical Examiner). Good chemistry and good for a few laughs in between the drama. Sorry to say that for me, personally, it isn't anything to get overly excited about but it's not too bad a show. I will more than likely buy the second season. It was entertaining enough. I would probably rate it at least 3 1/2 stars, almost to 4 stars.
550, Two thousand years ago, northern Britain's native people, the Picts, rallied against the Romans.  In the northernmost outpost, a small garrison was massacred, except for second-in-command Quintus Dias (Michael Fassbender).  He is rescued by the Roman's Ninth Legion, commanded by popular General Virilus.And then the Picts take on the Ninth Legion.So this is a sword. spear, and archery intensive, blood spattering (as in the300), chase, get caught, and escape type movie.The Romans, supposedly one of the most sophisticated and well-trained armies of the world, don't fare very well.  And why does escape seem to involve tramping over snow-covered mountain ridges, sensuThe Lord of the Rings?  Aren't there better ways to escape detection and get from point A to point B?There were just enough problems like this that made the plot irritating.  Be warned.
551, I must say that this is one of my all time favourite albums. I have to say that the best rack is by far the detriot mix of &quot;What's Going On&quot;. At first I thought their was an  error in my speakers (marvin appears to only come from the left), but when the familiar harmony (Father, Father) came in on the right, I was completely blown away. Don't just take my word for it. Buy this album NOW and listen to perhaps the greatest album by one of the 20th Century's most gifted talents.
552, I just got this phone as a replacement for my Curve 8300.  Boy, was I impressed.  It runs fast, keeps up with my typing & you can do most anything on this phone.  Email set up is a breeze & I love using the custom ringtones for people in my address book.  You can easily create your own wallpaper & songs for it and upload without confusion.The downsides are:  No video and I DETEST that the memory card is behind the battery, making it take forever to power down and access.  Beware, this phone takes awhile to boot up, but once it gets going, it's fantastic.I've read that the USB connections go bad on these phones and when my Blackberry Curve 8300 stopped charging, I believed it.  But I loved it so much, I bought another.  I checked out the new Bold but was unimpressed by it's bulky size and the flat keyboard (makes it hard to type) - this phone is MUCH better!
553, The most insightful, incredible album I have ever heard.  Stevie further subdues me into his music with this 2 cd album.  One of the amazing things about this album is that all these songs still can and do apply to things in our everyday life and that is one incredible feet for an album nearing 30 years old.  Superb songwriting and musicianship makes this album a totally and utterly must have essential in any collection regardless of you liking Stevie Wonder's music or not.  A few songs to check out on this album: Village Ghetto Land, Knocks me off my Feet, Summer Soft, As, Black man, and I Am Singing...but all songs are precious
554, I've been using this product for about a month now. I am very happy with the results. I've had some drying/peeling but I got it under control switching to a gentle face foam cleaner (Olay) with a facial loofah pad instead of my Neutrogena soap bar. I have a very oily T-zone with large pores. I'm 44 and have hormonal chin breakouts monthly. Afirm has really smoothed my skin and balanced the color tone very well. Also my pore size is smaller (or less noticeable). I still apply a very light dab of benzoyl peroxide my chin nightly for the breakouts after using Afirm. I also like the fact that you can get the grade that you need and go stronger slowly. I think the price is great compared to most and does the same job.
555, If you have a Samsung Galaxy Note 2, S3 or S4, this is a phenomenal case.  It has the metal belt clip that slips on and off along with a belt loop that fits most running belts.  The case also has a neck strap loop!I run distances of 10 miles or more and stream my music via bluetooth to my sunglasses.  This case does not hinder the signal.The case is easy to open and close.  This case is better than the $30 case I used before.  My running belt is an Amphipod.
556, I found this show when looking through a list of comedy TV shows free to Prime members.  Oh my goodness, I'm glad I found it.  I like all of the main characters (at least as much as Victoria is intended to be liked and OH BETTY WHITE) and the show is VERY WELL written.  All episodes are funny but some are exceptionally funny.  Some are touching, too.  It's rare that I buy seasons of TV on DVD, but I may have to because I watched seasons one and two through Prime and really want to know what has happened since.  Without commercials, each episode is about 22 minutes long, so you'll go through seasons quickly.  This was a great mid-day pick me up when I came home for lunch each day.  Highly recommended.
557, I needed a bathtub that would work for both my infant son and my 3.5 year old daughter.  My daughter freaks out in the bathtub, and I thought that getting a smaller tub would help her to feel more secure.  I also needed a new infant tub.  I really like the size of this tub, because it is huge (though it still fits easily into my standard size tub).  It has a nice contoured reclined position on one side to hold my infant son, yet the sitting position on the opposite side provides ample space for my 3.5 year old daughter.  This is the second time I have purchased a Primo brand product (the first time was a Primo potty), and I have been very pleased both times.  I think that the plastic could be a little bit thicker, but I think it is durable enough to withstand several years of use.
558, it's ok if you need to find something nearby but the listings are incomplete.  I was expecting it to have more complete listings than it does.  If I need to find a bank or a fast food place when I'm someplace away from home, it comes in handy.  But when I'm trying to find a business that I know is in the area, I often don't.  I'll find some of the same type of business but not always the one I'm looking for.  It would be much better if it were more complete.
559, I had read Without Remorse more than ten years ago and came upon it again as an audio-book. I do a lot of driving and find a story well researched, well written, and well read, a pleasure that makes the investment in driving time easy. Traffic jams, and delays are now endurable.John Clark is a man focused upon Justice. He makes the effort to identify the problem and those responsible then sets about to correct the situation without lawyers. The world needs more men like John Clark.
560, I have read each installment of this series as it has come out.  This is the first one I have refused to finish.Aside from being unnecessarily verbose, the story is told from no less than a dozen points of view.  There is only enough time to start to get the rhythm of one character's narrative before the text abruptly jumps tracks to another character.  As a result the myriad perspective changes read as nearly frenetic, and the flow of the story is quite disjointed.  This is more a collection of vignettes than a novel.  It almost gives the feeling that Mr. Martin has begun writing specifically for the purpose of an easy conversion to screenplay.
561, The wall charger, car charger, and USB cable are each in a sealed plastic bag without any additional packaging - no clam shell or cardboard box.  The quality is definitely not top-notch.  But, then again, the price is right and it works!The wall charger works well.  There is even a red light when you plug the charger into the wall.  Unlike other reviewsers, I am happy to report that my iPod Touch 2nd Generation was fully functional while it was charging.  The wall charger was also compatible with Apple's USB cable.I have not tried the car charger but I will mainly use the wall charger so I am not in that much of a hurry to test it out.  I highly recommend this inexpensive and useful product.
562, I do know Ariat footwear runs a little large but would rather have that than too small, I just order a 1/2 size smaller. I wear a size 10 normally and I ordered a 9 1/2 wide in these Heritage boots, (the wide because of high arches) fat baby short boots 9 1/2 and Ariat clogs 9 1/2 all from Amazon and I love all of them. These Heritage boots I wear for mowing and to church. They are comfortable and look great. I read where some one commented that the stitching was to white but that didn't bother me and didn't last very long just wearing the boots day to day.  I love the distressed look and the softness of these boots. I would and will purchase more Ariat brand footwear in the future. tb 7/2/14
563, I have one of these,  everyone in the sprint store was using them and suggested it to me,  and it's the best headset I've found to date.  It cancels noise out just fine, and I hear very well.  On occasion if I'm on speakerphone and someone else on this headset model or vice versatile then there's some slight choppiness but,  for the most part it's the best headset imve encountered so far.  I'd suggest this headset to anyone.  Just be careful with the. Earpiece. It's delicate.  I know a few people who have broken theirs,
564, Well, no mascara that I know of looks totally natural (except one by Shiseido that is no longer made, as far as I can tell). I've been iso a light-weight mascara in brown that has just enough umph to cover the powder that most shadows make on lashes. This one is the best I've found--after trying more expensive department and drugstore brands. I still would like to find one that deposits even less mascara-stuff on the brush, but it helps if I wipe the brush with a tissue before applying to lashes.I'm in my 50s, and most mascaras make me look worse instead of better. Somehow that mascara-y look is severe and accentuates wrinkles and aging, I think. I'm thankful I revisited this one, as I enjoyed it back in the 70s as well.
565, I have almost nothing but good things to say about this entire series. This book kept me on the edge of my couch the entire time! I'm kind of nerdy, so all of the technical details really added to the richness of the picture for me. This shot straight to the top of my favorites.The ideas covered in this were also very mind-expanding. I do have to say, I wish there was more time given to any kind of gayness or a gay struggle in this. Women enjoyed great status, however. I liked that.
566, Marvin Gaye broke out of the mold of Motown crooner on this album and came into his own. This is one of the best albums ever, and an incredibly woven concept album also. Marvin Gaye was able to articulate the turmoil in America at the time so well, and his singing as well as the music are AMAZING. This album contains one of my favorite songs of all time too, "Inner City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holler)". He was even able to tie in the melody  from "What's Goin' On" at the end of the song, which is one of the many touches that give this album its cohesiveness. I would recommend "What's Goin' On" to any music fan. It is a timeless classic and should be considered an essential for any collection.
567, It is a BIG WASTE OF MONEY. The Diaper genie is good for when your baby is an newborn (1-3 months) After they are 4 months there doo doo really stinks and the smell does come out a little bit even if you change it every other day. The inside gets  horrible smell like something died in it. It is very hard to replace the refill. Even though they discontinued selling the original they still sell the refills for the original right next to the the wide refills. So for my baby shower I recieved the original re-fill for my wide genie. And I did not notice it untill I tried to replace it so I already opened the origianl refill and some how broke the darn thing. So right now it is in the garbage. Money down the drain.
568, If you like to play Sudoku, you will really enjoy this game.  It has Easy, Medium, Hard, and Extreme games.  It includes History, Settings, How-To, and Share. If you are playing a game and need to close, it has a Resume Game feature. There's a Competition button that will show you the date and time of a competition game.  I haven't used this feature so I don't know anything about it. However, I assume it's an online game where you play other people.  There's also Undo, Redo, Validate, Hint, and Solve.  The Validate feature is used to verify that you don't have any errors. This is a great feature for people who are just learning to play Suduko. This is a great app and I highly recommend it.  I haven't had any problems with it on my Sprint LG LS670 phone.
569, This was not easy to use. It's very dark, it sprays out thick and it gets all over your hands if you touch it. Even after it's dry, it's still possible to stain your hands. It's not easy to wash out. Do not sleep with it in. It will stain anything your hair touches. Think of it as hair spray paint that dries kind of chalky. It's similar to charcoal in the way it feels. I don't recommend for daily use only because you must wash it out daily. For women, this dries out our hair. Do not try to work out or sweat and wipe your hair with a white towel. You will regret it (&#62;..&#62;)
570, I've been using this app (actually, the Pro version) for months now, usually a few times a week for running. It worked great on my old phone, but when I got an upgrade, it suddenly started crashing every time I wanted to access any feature in the settings menu. Now I can't change the GPS update frequency, stride length, etc. without the program completely failing. When I emailed the devs about this, I got an automated message back saying that they were too small (workforce-wise) and too busy working on another app to address the issue anytime soon.I still really like the app, but if you're going to buy the pro version and it ends up not working well on your fancy new phone, you've been warned.
571, I just picked up one of these so the next time I go to a convention and use my !@#$% smart phone all day I won't find myself getting a low battery alert. Right now I've got my Bold plugged in to this toy, running a frakking movie and running Bluetooth and the thing is still charging the battery! The dingus comes with a plethora of adapters for different devices. As long as what you have can take power from a USB port (that's +5 VDC to the uninitiated), this baby can power it. Worth $40!BTW, I have now tried this on my Blackberry Playbook tablet and it WILL charge it!
572, I can not believe that AMC didn't let this series have a second season.  It was one of the best shows television has to offer and ranks right up there with some of the British spy shows that excel far above our own.  It was a spectacular adventure full of excitement that kept you on the edge of your seat. I loved each one of the actors in their roles. The story is about Analysis done by a group of people who are able to "connect the dots" to protect the USA from foreign and domestic enemies willing to destroy our way of life.  It's a shame Showtime doesn't pick this up, because they would at least promote the series.  I didn't even realize it was on television until the first and final season ended.
573, I really wanted this app on my Kindle and downloaded it, but could not figure out how to use it, too much time to try to look up a food to add to the food diary portion. It always wanted me to put in the information like calories, etc. I thought the program already had that information so I could just click on a food and it would add up all my calories. This takes up too much of my time, and it is easier and faster to look up a food in a book and get the info. Too bad too, because I was so excited to get this program.
574, I work on my own cars, always have, always will. This is a good little checker for coolant clarity, boil over protection, and freeze protection. It isn't so technical, as it just measures density of the liquid, though it shows the clarity of the liquid within the radiator. I have heard that you can do a voltage check as well on coolant, though coolant is cheap and doesn't need to be changed very often (some claim 150,000 miles or 5 years now). Whatever the case may be, checking for coolant color and clarity is always good, and ensuring that you don't boil over or freeze is good to know.
575, Missy Peregrym is always a wonderful to watch.  If she could even do have the things she did in the movie Stick It this is one tough actress.  With a good supporting cast she and the others make each case interesting and shows some of the mundane sides of the job.  In one episode she leaves her gun at the station by accident and many of us real cops have done it too forgetting to get it after we've spend 2 to 3 hours booking a prisoner and then getting a call we have to answer.  Getting locked out of the patrol car in one episode.  Yep, I've done that too on a traffic stop.  So they are showing real things that happen but teaching the rookies it happens.  It's a light drama for the Canadian police.
576, This is a high energy version of the 1983-4 Tour of The Police, their last until the Reunion Tour of 2007-8.  I love watching this video.  It is well produced technically, although a few clips from the Montreal concert made it in the concert from Atlanta.  Some of the clips of the audience are actually from the Montreal concert - but it doesn't really matter.  The audience focused on represented the passion of the people and the music. The audiences embracing the songs, and the strong interesting music and lyrics. The Police (mostly Sting's) writing has many different flavors, tempos, bass lines.  The prowess of Andy Summers and Stewart Copeland are there also. For me this video captures my experience at a recent Police concert I attended - and I love recreating this feeling and experience.  Sting is wild in this Tour, colorful, and dynamic.
577, This is THE most used app on my Kindle and phone, love that you can look up ANY food or even program in your recipes so that you get not only an accurate calorie count, but also a full nutrition breakdown. You can look at your daily intake as a detailed page or as a pie chart broke into fats/carbs/protein which makes it easy to see what needs paring down. Love that you can syn it to other diet apps too, and that you can link up with friends using it too so that you can be a cheerleader for your other dieting friends!!!! When used daily it helps keep you honest and accountable and really lets you see where you need help the most!!
578, I can't believe the crap I 'm reading here. How many of you trashing the blu-ray were fans back in 1983? I had this on CASSETTE.....AUDIO cassette.......two of them back in the day. I loved it then and I love it now...to finally SEE it...sorry if you're disappointed the blu-ray doesn't look like blu-rays recorded today.I just wish you'd shut up or someone else might not pull something so awesome from the vault like this... and the bonus material is fabulous.if you're reading this wondering whether or not to get it, stop wondering. it's great. the opening version of once upon a time in the west is alone enough to make it worth the money. just stellar arranging. mark was and is a fabulous MUSICIAN.
579, I grew up using Fram filters, 2 years ago I was watching the Powerblock on Spike like I do every Saturday morning that I don't have to work and they did a cutaway comparison to Fram filters. I was inpressed at how well built these are compared to Fram and that the back flow disc is rubber and not cardboard. The 1 inch nut on the end makes removal from any car I've ever worked on a breaze. Much easier than using filter sockets, wrenches, and strap wrenches. Every vehicle I work on whether it's a family members, friends, or even my Harley has a K&N oil filter on it.
580, The first double album in hip hop history is well worth the purchase.  This album is considered by many hip hop fans as a classic.  Shakur was out of jail and hungry in the studio.  He did not disappoint.  This album changed the game in 1996 and established Shakur as a powerful artist in music regardless of genre.  Production is flawless.  The last two or three songs on the 2nd CD were not as potent as the other tracks; however, one cannot deny that this is a true hip hop classic in every sense.  A must have for the collection!
581, I got this for my boyfriend, who wants to quit biting his nails.  Because I like to do terrible things to myself (apparently, at least), I put a tiny, tiny dab of this stuff on one of my fingers - not even my finger nail, just a random place on the top joint.What I learned is that, while I may not bite my nails, I put my fingers in my mouth a lot.  At the very least, I put them in my mouth twice within an hour, and let me tell you - I did not put my fingers back in my mouth for the rest of the day, especially because this stuff doesn't just wash off.  I have no doubt that if I put it on my fingers tomorrow, I wouldn't put them in my mouth later that day, either.It's terrible, and since that's the whole point...great job, guys at Mavala.  That was disgusting.
582, this is exactly what it looks like.  when the junk plastic catch broke on my RV, I replaced with this.  since the catch is so long, I had to bend it a bit to make the angle right, but thats due to my mounting.  no fault on the product.  this thing holds the door securely and looks like it will stand up to sun and ran much better than the plastic ones.  It's been installed for about 3 months now with no trouble yet.
583, There's little rhyme or reason to the track order of this disc, but, folks, this "Looney Tunes": whoever expected rhyme or reason from them? Actually, the tracks are a delight: a blast from your childhood past, an instant tonic when you're blue, and a cheerful accompaniment for sunny days. Nor is Stalling to be underestimated: for decades he was one of Warner Bros. buried treasures; to this day he's hardly a household name, even though almost everyone on planet earth has heard his music. The accompanying booklet is very informative; the producers' love for this labor shows abundantly. If you can luck into a good deal on this CD with a dependable seller, go for it.
584, These bottle nipples work as intended. Our baby never did the jump to the largest ones (I.e. fast flow, etc), so we had to keep using this kind for several months. The thing is that, at the end of their lifetime, the 2 holes on top widen and allow more liquid to go through. When that happened, the baby would refuse to drink anymore and it was really frustrating. I'm not knocking off any stars on this review because it is not really a defect or downside. It's jut the result of normal &#8220;&#34;wear an tear&#8221;. Just be mindful of it.
585, My anger with RR Martin will not allow me to give it a 5. If he doesn't hurry up and write I'm going to lose my mind. Realistically he is becoming somewhat scattered. I was a &#34;Tales of Malazan&#34; fan, the author began telling so many stories that you couldn't follow them all and at the end he didn't really answer the questions he developed. I feel like the same is happening here. I hope he narrows his narratives and fleshes out the characters we have now. Still by this book you already know. You also know you aren't going to stop now.
586, The iTorch IMP52D is really a great external battery. It has a great aesthetic and compact design that is perfect for travel, and works well when recharging my phone (Samsung Galaxy S3).What I like about the device:Sleek, slim design that is compact.Fast charging time- faster than my time with the OEM cable.Intuitive yet minimal display. There are 4 small blue LEDS on the front face of the device. The far most left one turns on if it is charging your phone. The other 3 display the amount of battery left, each LED would be 1/3 full capacity.Can acts as a laser pointer and flashlight too!What I don't like about it:I don't think there is anything that I don't like about it, in particular.I think this external battery is a great product. It is small enough to be quite mobile and powerful enough to fully charge my phone and more. Great Value for price. Note I got it here for $39.95.
587, Not only is this gate incredibly easy to install and incredibly sturdy, but it is also great for pets.  We don't have any children, but we do have two dogs and two cats.  The dogs are constantly trying to get at the cats' food and litter box.This gate is actually a replacement for another gate we had to keep the dogs out, but it was flimsy and hard to maneuver around.  I just installed this gate in about 10 minutes and it's great because the cats can still have the run of the house by jumping it.  It also keeps our Black Lab from passing through.Buy this gate!  It's a wonderful, well thought-out product.
588, When you want comfort, good looks,  and good wear Dickies will bring it.  One suggestion - wash them before wearing for the first time - much softer after one wash.  No wrinkles when you get them out of the dryer quick.  As to size - Dickies is not generous in providing extra room in the waist - order your true size (no elastic stretch here).  I wear them to work in a business casual environment - now most people would not do that but I look like some one who would so I can get away with it, if you are looking to rebel a little then you can too.  Dickies are a great replacement for jeans when actually doing physical work our outdoor activities as they will dry faster than jeans if you get caught in the rain.  I also use as a replacement for jeans when on my scoot.  Four stars for wear, quality, fit and value.
589, My wife has been through three of these watches. She loves the functions of the watch for work, but the bands keep breaking. So far, googling hasn't shown a source for replacing the watch bands.It shouldn't be too difficult. The watch body itself just pops right out of the rubbery band. Given the tremendous amount of bands that are breaking, I'm surprised that someone over in China hasn't started making a living from selling replacement bands. But even eBay doesn't have anything.I'm wondering if we can find a craftsman to fabricate an alternative?
590, I really was amazed at how well these little boots felt when I went on a trip to Germany.  I have torn cartilage in one of my knees and must insert orthotic insoles into every pair of shoes I wear.  These boots absorbed the shock when i was sightseeing and were easy to take on and off during the long overseas plane ride.  I only wish they were made in a size like A or AA because I have a very narrow foot, but I'll  take anything I can get.  I liked the black ones so well I bought the brown pair.
591, This is my fourth Plantronics 330.I lost the first one, the Rottweiler ate the second one, and with the third one, the terrier chewed off the rubber piece that fits in the ear.Blue tooth headsets, I found, are a very personal thing.  Some did not fit 'right' and one gave me an earache. The Plantronics 330 fits me the best and once I became accustomed to putting it on, I can do it with one hand.I wear glasses, so I have to adjust the earpiece to fit over the ear along with the arm of the glasses. It only takes a moment and even though both are over one ear, it is still very comfortable.
592, This is the first book in a series. I like this one a lot more then Green Mars and Blue Mars (which I could not even finish) Too much description of Mars. Page after page of it sometimes. The plot is actually pretty good when it moves along, which it does pretty well from time to time. But lets be honest here, the main character is Mars. It gets more time in this book then anyone else.  Maybe that's what they call &#34;Hard&#34; Sifi. Lots of talking about the world, or technology. If that's what you like, this has lot of it.  If you are more in to a plot and narrative driven story, this book is only about half that.  Give it a shot, but don't let the first 20 pages or so fool you. The story starts fast and strong, but then quickly takes back set to Mars.
593, These are a seriously good deal for $10 and change! I've been running Mobil 1 Extended Performance through these, changing the filters every 5k miles and the oil every 15k. The K&N; has done it's job well when using some of the best oil on the market for extended service.I have 25k on this combination of filter and oil and have recently done both compression and oil analysis tests (at the 100k service) that have confirmed they're doing their job at protecting my motor. The compression test reported nearly the same numbers as I had at 60k when I was changing the standard Mobil 1 every 5k miles. This is particularly relevant considering I have a little 4 cylinder motor that lives around 4,250rpm on the highway.Whether or not the filter is more responsible than the oil, or vice versa doesn't matter to me. What matters is that both items are doing what they need to do to keep my little Scion purring along at 36mpg. It would be a bargain at $15.
594, Lately there have been a lot of movies about the Roman Empire's reach into the British Isles.  There was the King Arthur retelling with Clive Owen and Keira Knightley.  And soon after that was Colin Firth in the Last Legion.  Now we have Centurion, about a group of surviving roman centurions who struggle to reach friendly ground after their legion is destroyed by Picts.  Combining great scenery, bloody violence, raucous humor with betrayals and backstabbing, this movie shows life in the Roman Empire as brutal and bloody.  And yes, we have warrior babes, more than in previous sword-fighting movies.  The soundtrack was a disappointment; for a movie with scenery and cinematography like LOTR, the background music was totally forgettable.  Outside of that, this was an above-average action flick.
595, This is a nice watch and I decided to keep it, even though it is a different color than what is stated in the description.  I expected a black strap, but it is actually a very dark brown.  I could understand how someone might mistake it for black, someone who may not pay that close attention to colors.  But those of us who do will immediately recognize it as a dark brown.  It's still an attractive and useful watch, so I decided to keep it anyway.
596, Being a Pac fan from Digital Undeground and his days in Juice, I can honestly say this album was a success because of the circumstances around it.2Pac had just got out of jail. There was high curiousity on what he was gonna do or profoundly say. The answer wasn't much.Most of the best songs, with the excepttion of Checkout Time and Skandalouz, made it to the airwaves. The other half was just filler. (Do like I did and burn it to a single disc for maximum enjoyment).Lyrically, it's the same Cali-stuff, cars and "ridin". The beats make this album. After all, the duet with Snoop and Dre is what most remember. However, there's a few here and there that sound recycled. So..There you have it. An HONEST and fair All Eyez On Me review, beside just repeating how great Pac is. Thanks for reading. :)
597, My rating for this product is at a solid 4.5. The capacity is very close to advertised, but works hard to recharge my Nook Color at 4000mAh@3.7V. The unit is mostly used as a desk charger for my wife's Iphone 4S when at work (teacher), and performs that task perfectly! The build quality is as expected. The functionality and directions are easy to use, and as expected. Recharge time does vary depending on the AC/USB Converter, but the item does get a full charge as expected.
598, Hate those clip latches for the rv/travel trailer door? Worse yet, have a broken one? This is THE quick, easy and simple solution.Installed this right over former clips (even used the same screw holes). Rather than installing sideways (horizontally) as shown, do so vertically. It allows the hanging t portion to drop down when not in use rather than clank agains the side of the camper. It latches just as easily but also reduces the little amount of "give".This is much more stable than the clip. Less prone to break and a great price. Super easy to install.
599, I'm no scholar, haven't an encyclopedic knowledge or memory, and am unable to discuss erudite thematic stuff.  I met sci-fi in the late-Fifties, went back to Verne, Stapledon, et al, and haven't stopped reading it.  If it's an interesting idea, I'll read it.  A good story starts with that &#34;what if?&#34; and runs with it - how things might look, what are some consequences, how do the people live it.  A great story will draw one in, captivate and enthrall, and not let go.  One lives it, one cares what happens.  The story ends.  One acknowledges, and wants more.This is a great story.
600, What was I thinking? What was I expecting for 4 bucks? I thought I was getting a solid hard plastic product(maybe I didn't read closely enough). Instead I got cheap hollow thin walled plastic that isn't fit to chock a tricycle, let alone a 10,0000 lb trailer. These things will obliterate the first time a tire even comes in contact. Your tongue jack, and stabilizers are the only thing that will hold you. Don't even think about using them when you disconnect from your truck unless you're on perfectly level ground. use a piece of fire wood. These things will crack like an egg in cold weather, and melt like putty on any day over 60 degrees. Isn't there some sort of safety standards for this sort of product? Don't waste your money.Wasn't even worth the time to return.
601, Only every once and a while does a rap masterpiece like this come out (i.e. Biggies &quot;Ready To Die&quot;, Eazy E's &quot;It's on 187um killer etc.). This album was Tupac's first with Death Row and he did not dissapoint with songs to get you're head moving, or your brain thinking he did it all on two discs of pure west coast goodness. And I know this is going to get me alot of negative votes but...please let the man R.I.P., no more of these ... &quot;hes alive&quot; theories, he's gone and you have to accept it,sorry.
602, Our 4 month old son outgrew the First Year's Infant To Toddler Tub within a few months. He wanted to kick the water, but was kicking the plastic instead, which made him unhappy. I finally bought this bath. He tried it out yesterday and he was so happy! He fit in the tub very nicely. He could finally kick and splash in the water. In this bath he can splash the water with his hands too. He looked really crammed in the First Year's tub compared to this one. He stayed in the bath for 40 min splashing, laughing and cooing nonstop. No matter how much he moved, he stayed well secured.Great bath! Yes it is big, but that is the point!
603, I really use this app.  It is easy and convenient and is like having a nutrition expert in your pocket.  Makes you self-conscience when you know you have to put it in, it is easer to pass on the wrong things and look for a better choice.  It has so many menu items from dozens of restaurants and this can really be enlightening.  Things I thought were good have shocked me in calories, protein and sodium.Only thing I wish it had was a place to put in supplements that you take.  My doctor has me on a couple and I cannot enter them so I usually look deficient in some that I know I am not low on.
604, The KISS "Crazy Nights" video is a video all KISS fans should check out.  While "Lick it Up" and "Animalize" were the best non-makeup 80's albums KISS released, "Crazy Nights" still rocked.  So it is defintely a thrill to own three videos for "Crazy, Crazy Nights", "Turn On The Night", and "Reason to Live" all on one cassette.  All of the videos and the songs were great, and the girl who was in the "Reason to Live" video was a total babe, and so was the one in the "Turn On The Night" video.
605, What could be said about K&N; that hasn't already been said?  Wrenches on & off with ease.  With this filter, I have confidence & peace of mind.  I have used K&N; on everything from 1/4 mile cars, to little Hondas, to heavy duty trucks & SUVs.  But don't just take anyone's word for it.  If you've found this product online, that means that you are smart enough to use a search engine.  Read the independent analysis.  Plenty of guys have taken filters apart for examination, and done oil analysis.  Sure, there is no way of saying which filter is absolutely the best.  And I for one do not limit myself.  But K&N; filters have a space in my shop right next to aFe, Mobil 1, Motorcraft, & Wix.aFe 44-LF007 Pro Guard D2 Fluid FilterMobil 1 M1-104 Extended Performance Oil Filter, Pack of 2Motorcraft FL820S Silicone Valve Oil Filter
606, This is a great product for anyone living in America or overseas like we are. Our apartment is made with solid concrete and I am able to hear the monitor all the way in the front of the house. We have an older child that likes to play loudly so we put the baby in the back bedroom and I am able to hear when she wakes up. I think if I were to buy another monitor I would get one that has a video camera in it, so I could also see what was going on. But this is a great product considering the price.
607, I think this product is exactly what you see in the picture. It is the same head-set that you would get when you purchase a brand-new Blackberry. They have a different jack-size, and if you owned a Blackberry you know what I am talking about (for those who don't, it is a standard size headphone jack, and not the smaller size). It is perfect because you pay only a few dollars here instead of more than 5 times what you would pay at a retail store. Why pay their 500% mark-up when you don't have to. I feel also that these headsets are far better than any bluetooth because in a bluetooth you can only hear the person in one ear, while here you can hear them crystal clear in both! Plus bluetooth is far more expense if you are going to get a decent pair. I highly recommend these headsets to any Blackberry user.
608, I like this movie because although there was plenty of blood and guts, there was some story there too. It was not formulaic, not too &#34;Hollywood.&#34; I especially like the opening and closing line being the same (which I won't spoil for you by quoting it!) Very clever, I liked the writing and the main character is easy to root for, certainly.  It's one I don't mind watching more than once, so I bought it! It's a go-to movie for me when I need to unwind. Hope you enjoy it as much as I do.
609, I would have given this five stars but the tv production mars the picture, especially with the bright lights. The setting and story behind this show are well known.Unlike the crap mini-lp and cd, this has the full set from Red Rocks. Watch Bono and the boys unleash their talent on a stunned crowd. This dvd captures them revving up the famous War Tour which put them on the map. If you don't have the War album, order it today! (I wish they would put out an honest, simple album like that again. Why do we have to wait years for overproduced mush like their last few albums?)I saw them on this tour where the Alarm opened for them. Fantastic night. I put this in and I am back at the Pier in NYC watching this young band take flight (a few days after the Red Rocks show.)If you are a new fan of the band, get this and see where it all started.
610, These pads perform as expected and seem well made. Though wrapped with a velcro strap it is not necessary to use it. They are light and take up less space than several 2x6's (product description states, 2.8 x 6.5 x 8.9 inches ; 2.4 pounds). I highly recommend them. They fit my trailers' stabilizers perfectly. Great price and value, at least for now, I will update if this changes. The waffle design can trap dirt and if that is a concern just turn them waffle-side up. The idea is that the stabilizers do not sink into the dirt, not to support the full weight of an RV. They do what they are designed to do.
611, Dance with Dragons is book 5 of the Song Of Ice & Fire series. I feel like I'm reading a soap opera. At the end of book 5 we are no closer to a conclusion to this story than we were when book 1 ended. I have to admit it's a page turner but I hate falling in love with characters and having to endure their death, sometimes more than once. Now we have to wait until God knows when, to read book 6. I'm watching the HBO series and in a way I like it better than the books. I'm happy that Tyrion still has his nose in the TV show. He's my favorite character so I hope George Martin doesn't &#34;OFF&#34; him. I might not read book 6 if that happens. So if you're a person who loves long novels, hates when they end and can put up with a bit of blood and guts, this is your book. But hey! Start with book 1, Game of Thrones.
612, These wipers work, and they work really, really well.The package they are delivered in is easy to open. Securing the blades to the wiper arm on my car was very simple and easy as well.In terms of cleaning/wiping capability, they do great. Probably the best set of wipers I've ever had on a car, no lie. I used to love the RainX blades, but even out of the box there was a spot on my windshield where they would struggle. Not so with the Valeo,Highly recommended.
613, It's an average quality case/skin and will do the trick. Beware: If you get the Amazon bundle with the Screen Protector and Headphone adapter, you will be paying shipping for each of the three items. FYI - this has no bearing on my rating of this case, just know that the two cents more that you pay is not all you pay after figuring the shipping - it's more like $12 more. Avoid the bundle and buy it all from the same seller to avoid the triple ship charge. ;)
614, I knew even before I was pregnant that I wanted to use glass bottles- I don't believe that BPA-free means "safe," so I wanted to use something I could trust. These bottles are great (they come in two sizes; this review is for the larger, 8oz size). I freeze milk in them and defrost them in warm water and we have never had a crack or break yet. They wash better than plastic bottles because you can see the fat from the milk left on them when they are still dirty- it's hard to see that in the plastic bottles. They are easy to clean and not too heavy, but still strong enough to freeze/thaw multiple times. My daughter was able to hold them herself (of course we hover while she does that) and drink a bit when she was just a few months old, so they are not these huge and bulky bottles. Good quality and better safety.
615, I always try to count my calories but always failed because I hardly knew what calorie count was in most food I ate. With this app almost everything is already in the app and what's not can be added. I can login my calories without Internet and when I finally get a signal of internet it updates my online stuff. I love this app and it has helped me see what food I should stay away from and how to maintain a healthy diet. I lost weight already just from using this app (watching what I ate) and tracking my exercise and seeing results :)
616, I've always taken my Odyssey to the Honda dealer thinking they only OEM parts, but realized they are using CHAMP PH2867 filters.  It was so heavily torqued and hard to take out, I ended up using a flat head screw driver to poke a hole through the filter to remove.  The Bosch 3323 filter went on easily and hand torqued to snug fit.  It has a solid construction and I like the anti-drain valve feature to supply the engine with clean oil during cold starts.Used the following synthetic oil.MAG1 61792-pk6 Full Synthetic 5W20 SM Motor Oil - 32 oz., (Pack of 6)
617, The flavor is nice. My daughter seems to like it, and I personally tasted it and enjoyed it. The texture is off, however. Its too thick compared to the kids toothpastes we're used to. It might just be me, but its pretty hard to get it evenly distributed on my daughter's teeth.It'd be nice to see a flip top lid, as well. The current lid is a screw off lid (with a metal tub! I haven't seen that since the early 80's!) and its just kind of hard to juggle an ornery, hyper kid and load a toothbrush while having to screw off a lid at the same time. Its a minor complaint, I know, but its important to me.
618, This app has everything you need to track your daily caloric and exercise information.  The extra information provided regarding nutrition value is also an added plus.  The program gauges for you how long it will take you to lose a certain amount of weight within a time frame based on your caloric intake.  This program is far superior to hand recording the information.  It saves certain foods you eat routinely, so you can post again, and it provides a wonderful search for restaurant foods.  It seems to be very much up to date!  I like this app a lot.  I gave it 4 stars because I had some difficulty in working my way through the app, but then that's me, so don't take only 4 stars too seriously!
619, The premise that there exists an &#34;intelligence think tank&#34; is believable, if for no other purpose than to bring a different perspective to the analysis and interpretation of specific data.  The premise that there exists in the very deep shadows an organization that is interested in making huge amounts of money by influencing national policies and priorities is also believable.  The acting is good and you are kept in the dark as to who is on the &#34;good&#34; side thanks to very good writers.  I hope someday there is at least another season.  From the very first episode, I could see the similarity with &#34;Three Days of the Condor&#34;, which I also found to be quite credible.
620, We love this gate, it is so easy to install.  I just got rid of our superyard gate.  That was not very good to use because you have to climb in and out of the gate.  If you have an active child like mine, you will have to go in and out a lot.  Several times i trip over it and it's not fun when you bang your legs into the gate.  It is plastic but still it hurts!  Since we just change to this hands free gate, we are so relieved.  It's worth every penny!
621, Red Mars does have a plot - several actually - but the action meanders along in an almost dreamlike way.  Robinson spends pages getting his characters from point a to point b with little forward movement of any storyline.On the other hand, there is a major gap of years in the book's plot, and Robinson conveniently invents a reason for his suddenly much older characters to continue being vital.  Granted, such inventions are de rigeur in Sci-Fi.Nevertheless, the book is well-researched and well-written, making it a pleasure to read, even if I'm reading about driving through a canyon for the hundredth time.
622, If you love Monk's recordings you can't afford not to own this. Here is Monk performing many of his classics in a variety of settings in addition to a very well edited documentary. The non-performance clips do much to shed light on Monk's personality and includes interviews with Charlie Rouse and T. Monk Jr. I thought the sections with his son , while brief, were very touching and revealing of the private struggles that Monk went through.This may not have as much appeal to those who are unfamiliar with the mans' musical contributions but it is a fine film and a wonderful tribute to a true giant.
623, Fantastic..... the audio re-mastering is just superb.I have watched this concert on VHS many moons ago. Maybe something like 20 + years. We enjoyed it then, with whatever systems we had.Today I own a much better 2 channel stereo, as I am an addict to music. The audio quality just blew me away.... whew. I have had the audio CD for several years now but the audio on the DVD is just too good. The video quality is a bit disappointing though. They have not managed to improve on the VHS tape. My kids are fascinated by Mark's red boots. They have seen only his rather recent concert DVD's, where he looks prim and proper. :-)Hats off to the re mastering team. Thank you very much.
624, Review of New Trent iTorch(IMP52D):The iTorch is an incredibly useful tool for any road warrior. It lets you fully charge your phone and then some. I love the design and size of the device. It charges with the ubiquitous micro-USB cable, and it can charge anything via a USB Cable. I always keep it in my bag just in case. The only small issue I have is the amount of time it takes to fully charge. It take a few hours to get from zero to 100%. This is expected, but is still a significant amount of time. 4/5.
625, If you are like me and love the Song of Ice and Fire series you just have to get this and keep reading. The 4th novel  ( A Feast for Crows) was probably my least favorite in the series, mostly because the majority of my favorite characters were not in it and because so much happened in the 3rd book that the 4th just seemed slightly boring. George R. R. Martin delivers with A dance with Dragons though. So much happens in this book and some questions are starting to be answered. This is a must read for fantasy lovers and fans of the series. Please feel free to comment with any questions or theories about the series.
626, There are already lots of superlatives used by other reviewers for this performance.  Indeed, the dancing is superb and it is probably difficult to see something like this one in our days.  However, Margo F. is desperately and hopelessly old here, and although her dancing is perfect, I could not totally believe her interpretation because she was playing a 14 years old girl. She is well over 40 when this was filmed and it showed.  Somehow, I also noticed some rigidity in her movements.  I agree with some critics who say that she reigned in Royal ballet for too long and was careful to destroy all competition.  The result is this, although technically perfect but not very believable performance. Nevertheless, it is still a great one.
627, My son is breastfed and sometimes takes a bottle of pumped milk when i am away...the variable flow nipples seem to flow the same no matter which side you hold it on (I,II or III).  I have used the other nipples (1, 2,3) and the flow seems to be slower than the variable.  Milk just goes everywhere ....i think i will hold off on using the variable flow nipples until he is a bit older....great concept, they just didn't work as great as i thought they would.
628, My engine light was on and the ODB scanner (also purchased through Amazon) threw the P0134 code several times - no activity from the upstream O2 sensor (the one before the catalytic converter). After research, I bought this part.The sensors are easy to access without raising the vehicle. One good kick with a wrench and the Powerbuilt 648691 Oxygen Sensor Offset Puller loosened the old part and I unscrewed it by hand. The electrical connector took less than three minutes to figure out and remove. It took, perhaps, two minutes, to put the (included) anti-seize compound on the sensor threads and install it.It was very easy to do, and I saved at least $250 over repair shop parts and labor. I use a very good repair shop when I have to, but on projects like these, I prefer to do it myself.
629, I chose this card even though it had mediocre reviews because it was the only one I could find that charged by use, not a prepaid amount.  I went to europe and never used the card/phone and was charged for 3 text messages that I never got.  For $2.40 I didn't fight the error very hard but the fact remains I was charged for services not rendered.  Further, they were were after me for the $2.40 before I even got back from the 8 day trip.  (emails when I got home were already in my inbox)  Its not the money, its the principle, I don't like disingenuous companies.  For a lousy $2.40 they should have just said sorry and written it off.  I would have used the card on future trips but its in the trash now.
630, My skin has changed so much as I get older and I knew I needed a serum.  I've used Olay's products in the past and this one the company said on the box they have improved it.  This cost less than in the stores for me.  It's been over two weeks and already my face and neck is doing better.  My skin's smoother looking and feels smooth.  I am waiting to see if it helps with fine lines, even out my skin tone and whatever else it claims it can do.  I just follow what it says on the box.  AND it's fragrance free!  Since I can't spend $50 or more on the department store versions right now, I can fall back on this brand for sure!
631, I don't need to say much abut this one, exsept everyone who still hasn't bought it or is new 2 rap this is a important record for your collection. 2 discs of mind blowing beats, flows, lyrics. Is has it all. No songs to skip, of course some songs are better than the other. No weak material here and that's unbelievable for being a double disc. This will go down as one the best records ever. If you want rap lyrics visit : [...]Definitely recommend this for the collection if you don't have it yet. Is has plenty of guest and much stuff you can't bump at a party, in your car, at your system wherever you want. If fits everywhere! Be sure to check out &quot;Ressurection&quot; the soundtrack when it drops.One.
632, This should be a movie and William Defoe has just got to play Kelly/Clark!This is a definate departure for Clancy to focus closely on a single plot line, but he pulls it off expertly.  If you haven't read the earlier books, read them first.  This one is intended to fill in the dark background of the character you've already come to appreciate - and what a dark background it is!  And who wouldn't want to step into his shoes vicariously, brutally deal with some of the scum in the world (without any remorse), and get away with it all?  Sign me up!
633, The NewTrent IMP52D is an ergonomically designed charger for your personal electronics.  It works with USB charging cables to recharge your devices.  I purchased two, one for me and one for my wife.  When I can't reach people because their smartphones are dead, I will recommend this product.  The build in laser pointer is awesome, and it even has an auto-off so that the battery isn't depleted by leaving it on.  I can't wait to try some of NewTrent's other products!
634, I've just finished the 3rd episode and it's a good series. Unlike many American made series, which are emotionally based and lack depth in that they do not deal much with ethical issues or the human predicament we all find ourselves, this series does.This series is dealing with self reinvention, compassion vs callousness, the innate predatory instinct of all humans, what it is to trust and love, seduction of power, and yes, raw survival.I haven't seen ay idiot writing so far. The acting is good and the material is believable. I can actually see people acting like this.Also, there is a bonus. American series are 40-43 minutes each. That's because of advertising (nothing political here, just passing along a fact). BBC gives you a full 50 minutes with each episode, which means you get 25% more entertainment for your money.If you're looking for a shallow series pitched to about the 6-8th grade level mentality, this is not for you.
635, Lenore lives in &quot;The Silk House&quot; with her grandmother at the top floor.  They aren't servants, but they aren't family.  The owners of the Silk House are silk makers vying against a rival family in France.  Lenore falls in love and marries one of the sons of the house, but he commits suicide right after the marriage.  Or did he?  His brother wants her, too, but she will have none of it.  She opens a dressmaking shop in London, hoping to escape the past, but she soon learns that she can never escape the silk vendetta.This Victoria Holt book isn't as interesting as the others.  There is also a part with a dog dying that bothers me (I am very sensitive in regard to cruelty to animals).  Also, the &quot;bad-guy&quot; is really obvious.  Still, it is a good read and I would recommend it.
636, I was looking for game with large cards and realistic play. I finally found it! This game rocks!  Lots of action even without in app purchases. Side bets available. Log in bonus every 4 hours with additional bonuses available. When I reached about $5000, I was offered the opportunity to become a member of the exclusive club for FREE! I was awarded an additional $2500 bucks plus even larger log in bonus! Yahoo! Can't wait to see what other opportunities present themselves!  LOVE this game!
637, This is a very useful product that puts an end to perpetually slipping lingerie straps or falling socks, and has many other uses.  I wear trouser or knee socks a lot and even the best seem to lose elasticity, while others never stayed up well.  The resulting wad at my ankles is not attractive.  When a beloved pair, with a color I can no longer find, thus can't replace, begins to fall, I just use this roll on substance to hold the things up, which it does very effectively.  I've also salvaged split or ill-fitting tights for further use by cutting off the legs and holding up the remaining knee-highs with this product.  It works really well.You are completely unaware of the product once applied and it easily washes off from both skin and garment.  The roll on applicator is very easy to use and it lasts a long time.  Highly recommended.
638, I have 3 cats and one little shihtzu that is piddle pad trained so I wash my hands dozens of times throughout the day.  They get so dry that they crack and hurt so I was looking for a good hand cream that didn't feel heavy or leave a greasy feeling.  Hard to find one that does all that, but this one is perfect!  It absorbs right in and feels so light, yet leaves my hands feeling so soft.  When I first used it, my knuckles were actually so cracked they were bleeding and that cleared up in one day of use.  It has an amazing scent as well that make it a total winner.  I just ordered another bottle to have in my kitchen.  Love it.  Totally satisfied with price as well because I have paid much more for a good cream.
639, Probably the most boring scifi book. A lot of politics, very dull and boring descriptions about Mars ecology. Many text books are more interesting reading than this book.The plot is boring. Characters are dull, annoying, and uninteresting. There is no great character development here folks. Did I mention that the book is extremely boring. Don't waste your time with it unless you are stuck in an airport with nothing else to read, actually just go to sleep, and have some rest instead of reading this book.
640, One of the most important aspects about your car that probably never gets much attention to are the wipers.  Quality wipers make all the difference between driving safely and dangerously.  These wipers made by Bosch are some of the finest wipers I have used.  They are bracketless, and because of that, I feel it hugs the window a lot better and removes more water quicker.  They are made of quality materials, and work wonderfully.  If you notice smudges when you using your wipers, or see cracks on them, it is time to change them.  I would recommend you give these a try.
641, I love this game. it is both very entertaining and addicting. the controls are fairly simple and once you get in tune with the timing you are unstoppable!! Only problem is that it occasionally freezes and crashes. the good thing is my kindle fire doesn't crash along with it. it simply sends me back to the homepage. this is why I give it 4 stars. whenever I get close to beating my highscore it freezes and crashes. I filed a complaint and I hope the problem will be fixed. I am determined to beat my highscore!! :D
642, If this is the same movie that sometimes plays on Turner Classic Movies, then buy it. Butch Patrick plays as Milo in this movie. He is also the same boy that played in the 1960's TV series called The Munster's. His charachters name was Eddie Munster. Well anyway, this movie has lessons on words and numbers. There was a dispute about which was more important in this movie, words or numbers. It got resolved in the end. I am glad that it came out in the year 1970. It would be a shame if this movie was ruined by computer animation. I did like the artist depiction of Milo in this movie. The cartoon background was nice. And I also like how the screenwriter used a pun in this movie. Watch dog. The cartoon charachters dog was wearing a watch collar. It is comedic elements like this that make the movie entertaining and instructive.
643, I won't try to top the  Doc. from Washington's review. Same experience here. This is the fifth bluetooth device I've purchased and blows all the others away. My purchase of the H710 was on the strength of a friend's use of an H700. He was the only caller with a bluetooth ear device from whom I could hear every word clearly. This H710 is absolutely the best on everything from utility to comfort. Don't even consider any other. A rare home run from Motorola. Quite a contrast from my wife's crap Motor-oh-no V3m Razr phone. (In comparison to my Samsung U900, another winner).One thing I neglected to mention. Since this device doesn't violate your ear orifice, it may be used successfully with hearing aids.
644, I Use this on my HTC Evo 4G LTE. I spend alot of time outdoors, with the iTorch I no longer worry about having my GPS on and running my battery dead. I also find it vary helpful for charging and not have to worry about being plugged into a wall or car charger. The included case is helpful to keep the charger and USB cable together. I have used this on my Bluetooth also and it worked great. The 1 AMP out put charges quicker than the wall charger that came with the phone. The iTorch charger gets me about 2 full charges on my phone.Pros- Size, Easy to use, light weightCons- Have to turn on the LED light before you can turn off the charger.
645, I enjoyed this book, part 4b of the series, although I agree with many of the critics, too long, unnecessary new characters, little resolved.  But I love the series, first 3 books are 5 stars... I would really rate this a 3 1/2.My question however is this:  I have heard there are two more books before series ends....  George RR Martin is 64 years old and it took 6 years to release this tome.... Does he have it in him, especially with the other distraction of the GREAT HBO series, Game of Thrones, which I have heard he is also very involved, to finish 2 more 700-1000 page books....?Or is this another job for Brandon Sanderson, the person who is now finishing the late Robert Jordan's "Wheel of Time" series... Good Luck George...!!!
646, After 7 seasons Matt Groening's absurdist science fiction cartoon is showing its age.In this DVD set we see increasingly implausible stories like Zapp Brannigan marrying Leela's mother or Leela and Amy deciding to join a 'butterfly derby'for no compelling reason, or Bender developing a sudden interest in fox hunting.  Yet somehow none of these stories ever upset the cast's comfortable status quo.There are some fun episodes.  The 3012 elections feature a Hawaiian Senator who is accused of being an alien since he refuses to show his Earth certificate.  We learn more than we ever wanted to about robot reproduction when Bender has a son.  And we learn all about salmon, turtles and seals in a parody of nature documentaries.  But I didn't see anything too ambitious or memorable.Don't get me wrong, I still enjoyed the DVDs but the show is feeling increasingly tired.EDIT - apparently I'm not the only one.  The next season will be the last.  Oh well.
647, I like the ideas.  I like the characters.  But did I mention that it was really long?  I think that if you really studied this book you could create an entire 3 dimensional model of mars.  Mr. Robinson describes nearly every peeble and crevise on the planet as if he spent 16 years there wandering the barren wastes.The bottom line is - clip 200 pages of scenery description out and it would get 4 stars.  I would have never finished this book if I was reading it in book form.  I did it on tape and it took me about 3 weeks.
648, I should have known better than to purchase a dish soap that had a high fragrance, I thought this would be a nice change and allow me to actually enjoy washing dishes (no dishwasher) yes it smells great but leaves a bad residue, which you can taste on everything!! It's especially bad with plastic, it soaks up this soap like no other and even when you rinse it a million times, you can still taste it. Awful!! And yeah they're not green, this stuff gots chemicals too, just look it up on ewg.org.
649, We needed a considerably lengthy 3.5mm Male to Male stereo cable to connect a computer to our phone system, through a3.5mm Mono Female / RCA Male Adaptor, to the system's music on hold. This did the trick, and did it cheaply. The cost of this 25-foot cable is much more reasonable than cables of shorter length. I am very pleased with this. Sound quality was not a major consideration since it only has to play through the speakers of phones. Still, all things considered, I recommend this. What is there to lose at this price?
650, After owning multiple older Motorola models and a Plantronics (dumped that one in a day), this 710 is the "Best of the Bunch".  Folks that I speak with find it much easier to understand me, and the noise cancellation feature must work a bit, because regular road noise is no longer complained about.  Still, if a diesel truck is nearby, folks will hear it.  I wonder about the new 715?  Would like to give it a try too.  My son has a 710 also, and I do get some echo when speaking with him.  I am leery about trying the Jawbone, have heard too many fit issues.By the way I can't figure the person that complained about fit, I am 6'5" and a large guy, the ear loop fits me great!
651, I have completed all 5 books.  I enjoyed reading them a lot.  The stories were interesting.  There was lots of action and drama, some unsavory, some honorable characters, but it's all just too much in my opinion.  It's like getting a history of the U.S. with all details from 1650, when all you REALLY want to know about is the civil war and who won.  I will read books 6 & 7 if they ever come out.  I don't know if I'll ever RE-read them.  (Tolkien I re-read once every couple of years)
652, I have played quite a few games on this app. I also played on different apps. I liked the ease of the button format for several reasons. The pop up is a bit confusing until you are used to it. The &quot;see through&quot; pop up implys activity there is none, and also provides confusion in placement of notes. All in all it is not a bad format and may be preceded by some. However, if you just want a clean, clear cut board, then the button format is the way to go! ;)
653, I have used WIX filters for years and simply cannot say enough as to their reliability. It is the only filter that I trust from the thickness of the can to the design of the o-ring setup. In my one car I have datalogged 130+psi oil pressure and WIX has always worked perfect. Others I have seen (and had to replace) simply have inherent flaws. I have read a lot of tech information and when it comes down to it these are well designed and although there may be something new and fancier out there, it doesn't always mean it is better. I have used WIX in diesel cars, trucks, gas cars and trucks, and every race car that I have run for the past 20-years.
654, What could you say about New Edition member self-titled album.  While 15-years later, this album still has its effects as it's release date.  "Feels So Much Better" written and co-produced by the great Babyface falls inbetween the more dance tracks to prepare you for tracks 6 and on which contain all slow love songs for constant play.  With help from Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis every song that Johnny sang on this album is a single.  It's so good that even track 11, "My, My, My (reprise)", is a keeper as an instrumental interlude that last only 1:11.  Johnny Gill could set the mood right for any intimate evening.
655, I really, really like the unit. I have only owned it for a week or so but have had some good usage from it already. I previously owned a Zagg Sparq, and I did not like that it didn't hold a charge well, and the size. Even though the battery was almost twice the size of this one, it didn't seem to charge as well as this.I am a little confused with the flashlight and laser. I would prefer just a battery, and the only reason for me is easy-Sometimes I hold the button down too long and the light comes on. Getting that off and getting back to just the battery is kind of tedious, but I will get used to it.The size of the unit, awesome. I really like how it feels, very well constructed. I also like how easy it works with all of my devices. Flexibility is a real selling point, I love being able to use it on so many devices.
656, My previous favorite hair regrower potion reduced their percentage of active ingredient so I went to this name brand. I have thinning hair at the hairline, esp on one side. I don't use this as often as recommended, more like a few times a week, and just at night (as its supposed to be contraindicated for women.)My hair is so much fuller, and while it will never be and never has been a lush mane (except in the back!), I am really happy with the regrowth. In fact the side I was concentrating on, which was the sparser side, now is the more filled in side!I hope it doesn't do anything untoward to my system, but in the conservative way I use it, I will take the chance. Vanity prevails.
657, I had this video in VHS format and I always considered it as my best video ever.I dreamed it would exist in DVD one day and it became now a reality.So I bought it back immediately.the songs are perfect they sing so well, nothing to reject,from the vhs to the dvd I would have expected a better improvement in terms of image but I have no regret still.If you like these artists this is a key document to have at home and you will need to see it many times it's a masterpiece Thank you so much I can keep this fabulous concert in dvd now.Rush to buy it and you won't regret I can tell you !
658, I went through three wired headsets (I like earbuds for wearing with ski and bike helmets) - lost one and had two fall apart on me, so I went to this product.  But I am not impressed with this product - I can't get the earpiece to stay in my ear, except by twisting the ear loop and jamming the ear bud into my ear - it HURTS after just a few minutes of my 30 minute commute, or, if it isn't hurting me, it falls off and hits the ground or gets lost under my car seat.  The volume doesn't go high enough while I'm driving so I can't hear over the car noise (yes, I have a brand new, fairly quiet car)  Anyway, I'm debating returning it due to the discomfort factor.
659, Three cheers for Clint Eastwood for having the courage and fortitude to produce such a film as this. He recognized the genius of Monk and set out to film him in his element at a time when very few American film makers, record companies and the public at large had very little if any interest in Monk. The most remarkable thing about this film is that there is no narrator to put his/her slanted and narrow opinions and interpretations in and take reality out. There is no Denzel Washington nor Wesley Snipes to portray characters. No Quincy Jones or Spike Lee to explain the idiom. One can see and hear the voices of the actual musicians themselves in the process of living and creating music. Mr. Eastwood captured these realities at the beginning of Monk's decline and on to the end. The only film that comes close to this is Mingus "Beneath The Underdog". There is a lot of truth in this film, something that the American public seldom appreciates.
660, I bought this cd when it first came out, and I'm still listening to it now.  Both disks are very good all the way through and there is some varience in style from song to song.  This is the cd by witch all other rap  cd's should be rated.  There really aren't any lows on this cd.  I would  suggst this cd to anyone.  Even if you don't like rap you should give this  cd a listen beacause Tupac has something to say unlike alot of new rappers  that just talk about all of the cars that they have bought.  If you don't  already own this one go get it now. You won't be disappointed!
661, I used to break out in boils and get rashes underneath my breasts due to the hot humid weather in Florida.  I use this tea tree creme daily underneath my breasts and it helps keep my skin free from rashes and boils.  I used to have a reoccurring chronic problem with boils and the prescription medicines never completely cured my boil problem.  I started using this creme and I now have been boil free for over a year due to this product.  I highly recommend this product for boils and rashes.
662, When you are counting calories, this app is really helpful. You can build in your own foods to make recording faster. I like that it tracks everything from calories, to fat, to protein to even the basic vitamins. Useful to make sure you are also eating a well rounded diet. Only complaint is that it sometimes has issues erroring out &#34;synchronizing&#34; and can only be used if you have network connection. I don't always get good service at work so then I can't record. Would love an offline mode that can then be synched later.
663, Easy to replace. It lacks Toyota instructions, but it is exactly like existing Toyota part with all wires colored the same way so it is very obvious how to connect those.The original part has a silicone rubber tube going all the way from top to bottom with wires running inside it. This part only provides a short length of tubing that, at best, would cover half of the length of wires on my car.I thing they should provide a &#34;telescoping&#34; tubing of two diameters with one going inside of the other while you are crimping wires and then extended to cover the full length of wires
664, First, I must say that I rarely give a book 5 stars, especially fiction, but Mr. Clancy has created one of the most intriguing books I have read. The plot(s), characters, and dialogue are simply exceptional and for the first time with one of Clancy's novels, I can honestly say that it wasn't long enough. This a book that has it all.....action, fierce characters, compassion, heartache, oh, and did I mention ACTION. This will be one of the quickest 750 page reads you will ever have!
665, This is one sweet deal. I have been looking at this phone along with the Touch and Blackberry devices and after 2 months of research I finally bought my Tilt. I'm an IT admin here in Seattle and love my techy stuff. Day one I had it setup to our exchange server which was great because I have my email, contacts, and shared calendar with me at all times. I also downloaded numerous applications to help tweak the phone and make it even better. Day two I backed up all my settings and unlocked the phone and tried out the Google Bata app. called Android. Of course, unlocking your phone will void the warranty but I couldn't resist. This phone has limitless possibilities and is practically a miniature laptop.
666, Having the ability to track both food you eat and the exercise you do in one app is great. Makes you accountable to yourself.  My sister me to this app and now we keep track of how we are doing. You can invite others to join you also. I have the  app on my pc and my tablet.  The app sync each device so you only have to enter in one place and all you devices are update. Should impress my doctor when he asks how I am doing on my weight loss.

668, This particular fabric content on the compression under armour coldgear is great for very cold motorcycle trips  - under your jeans, much warmer than silk thermals.  Fabric also breathes well, so if you go into a heated building while taking a break, you don't feel like you are going to smother (although I will admit they don't breathe as well as the silk).  I also wore them outdoors & in museums while sightseeing during the worst snow storm in London in the past 20 years.I went a size smaller so they were tight and my regular jeans still fit.  I HIGHLY recommend them, I prefer them to the mid-weight silk, they can handle colder temperatures.  The matching mock turtle shirt is also great.
669, This is such a wonderful effort. It consists of mostly ballads, but Johnny Gill pulls it off on all the songs.  Sometimes, Johnny gets a little mellow on some cuts given the maturity and adult romantic feel of the songs. I still love the gorgeous Let's Get the Mood Right. It makes for good music to hear in the bedroom late at night.  Other favorites are Touch, Maybe and Having Illusions. I love the sexy It's Your Body and the late Roger Troutman of Zapp being on it. One of Roger's best of his final performances when he was alive. It still surprises me that he would follow the somewhat uneven Provocative with this well sung, well performed effort.  Staying true to himself and his vocal style is what makes his third Motown album my second favorite album by him.
670, This serum by Olay is wonderful!  It makes my skin look luminous, it has helped my crow's feet, and laugh lines.  It blends in easily, is not greasy at all, and my skin soaks it up. I wear it day and night.  It makes my make up glide on, and helps keep my make up in place.  I really like the way this serum makes my skin feel: hydrated, smooth, soft, but not greasy or oily.  It gives a nice matte finish to my face.  I will use this serum as long as Olay makes it!
671, This is a nice case.  It's not the smooth leather I was expecting but I still really like it.  I've found it very easy to get my iphone 3G out of the case by simply pinching the bottom like the instructions show.  But since I bought my iphone I've been looking for a case that I could clip onto my purse or a belt loop and I haven't found one.  So I finally gave up and made one.  I bought the Sena UltraSlim Pouch and the Smart Clip Cell Phone Caddy Holder from As Seen On TV (thru Amazon) and superglued them together.  I've made the perfect holder for the iphone...at least for me.
672, i dont think there's anything better on the market,man...this is some awesome stuff.he has guests like snoop,nate dogg,method man,dr.dre in their earlier days.the opening track,ambition az a ridah,has almost the tightest beat ever in rap music,plus its got that &quot;i cant deny it,im a straight ridah&quot; fabolous used on his hit.skandalous and all bout u have sweet hooks sung by nate dogg and the usual rockin verses by pac.after that we got the hardcore songs like #4,#6,and no more pain,plus the bangers heartz of men,how do u want it,and cali love.must have record the second disc is a bit more personal,but stilltight.recommended
673, My wife and I were glued to the TV watching this for its silly, but tense plot and spring-boarding to the next sequence. However, it had dialogue written either by twenty-somethings or the most cynical burnout screen writers around. Trite only begins to describe this dialogue. And the inattention to minor details in directing was very annoying. For example, the two protagonists pursuing an agent with a deadly viral weapon, have just landed at U.S. customs and enter the airport. They quickly begin using their guns against enemy agents. Now, really.Decent actors, decent cinematography. Just an utter lack of craft and artistry among the writers and directors.
674, This 1980's Stevie Wonder record is certainly one that will touch your soul.  Most of the songs consist of justsynthesizers/keyboards, drums, vocals, and special effects.  But oh do those special effects work especially on the oh so soothing  ballad, Overjoyed. There are plenty of good groove tunes such as Part Time Lover and Land of La La.Maybe this recording falls a little short of such classics as Talking Book and Innervisions.  However, Stevie still has a good sense of melody through most if not all of the songs on this release.  Combine it with the very pleasing album cover and the impression is a solid four out of five star score.
675, Some people will say its an amazing piece of film because it wasn't a major release, but in all honesty, it was just ok.  While the graphics weren't amazing, I still found the monsters themselves to be good.  The acting was alright but I just cannot get behind the instant love story.  There was a whole lot of build up to the infected zone and very little happened with it. All of that said, it wasn't a bad movie.  It is worth a watch if nothing else.
676, paid $3.17 here ....... cheaper than "wally world". I bought three as these work on my motorcycles. filters the dirt, protect my engine.the "classic" purolator filter is way better than a fram (more pleats of filter media) IMO.I'm using these on a Kawasaki EX 500 Ninja but the L14610 will fit any Kawasaki or Honda motorcycle that uses a cartridge oil filter and has enough room , these are approx. 3.25 inches in length .....Or you can use the L14612 which is shorter (2.5 inches in length).why give your hard earned money for the oem filters which are made as cheaply as the motorcycle manufacturer can buy them and branded with their logo.....crappy filters is what you get from the dealer..... I want my stuff to last, LOL.
677, The consistently excellent follow-up to "Talking Book". When you discover that there's hardly anyone on this album other than a blind guy, you really have to take your hat off to him. Sophisticated pop music that still sounds  fresh; lyrics which address the main issues that are still all too relevant  today.Due mainly to the deterioration of the vinyl, I hadn't played  this or the other Wonders I own for ages. Even though these new CD's  apparently are not remastered from the original tapes (Wonder owns them -  anyone know what happened?), the sound is excellent and the digipak edition  I have reproduces the sleeve, which is itself a classic, beautifully. It's  a winner!
678, Muirel Gray's Furnace grabbed my attention quickly and held it captive  through the first quarter of the book. Unfortunately,  I found my attention waning during the second and third quarters, as the story moved too slowly for my taste and introduced some sub-plots that were somewhat disjointed and/or uninteresting. Gray did  manage to recapture some of my attention and interest in the final quarter of the book but by this point I was as much interested in finishing it so I could move on to my next book as in finding out how the story ends.  Furnace could easily have been an  &quot;8&quot; or possibly a &quot;9&quot; with some necessary editing.
679, Having been released from prison just months earlier, Pac dropped one of the most anticipated rap albums in history and does not disappoint. For this brief period while he was alive, Pac really was untouchable. With renewed vigor and vengence, Pac took his lyrical assault with foes and the authorities to another level. The joint starts off with Ambitions of a Rider produced by Daz, which is probably one the most hardest first songs on a album ever. The cd just bangs till the end. Fav's are All about you, Got my Mind Made up, Picture me rollin, Thug Passion, Check Out Time, Cant See Me, California Love and All Eyez on me.
680, On 'For Once In My Life' Stevie utterly reinvents theschlockly showtune-ish sound of the original and blows it outthe window on the title cut,following that with the classics&quot;Shoo-Be-Do-Be-Do-Da Day&quot; and &quot;You Met Your Match&quot;-the greatest1,2,3 punch on a Motown album at this point!And along with theclassic &quot;I Don't Know Why I Love You&quot; mark the first uses of clavinet in his music!And it only gets better with the wonderful &quot;I'd Be A Fool Right Now&quot; and the soulful raver &quot;The House On The Hill&quot;.And guess what?NO FILLER!Stevie Wonder succeeds at producing an album with all quality material within the Motown style.He'd redifine it later but his own self-reliant artistic muse first shows up here!
681, This gate is really a great product. I love the fact that you don't have to hardware mount the gate (no drilling into the doorways required), and it's still very sturdy. It was incredibly easy to install, and is very safe and secure. My 18 month son knows how the gate opens, but cannot open it because of the weight required to push down on the lever. The only negatives I encountered were:1) The first Hands Free gate I purchased was not painted properly, so I had to return it for another one.2) I had to buy the 5&quot; gate extension for the gate to fit in the doorway. So, in the end, there are additional costs if the opening you intend to use the gate for is not that narrow. But all in all, it's totally worth it.
682, There are only three characters in THE DISAPPEARANCE OF ALICE CREED: two kidnappers and the rich young woman that they grab for ransom.  Most of the story takes place in a single setting, the apartment where the criminals hold the girl captive.Not wanting to be a spoiler, that's all I'm going to reveal about the story of this smart, fast-paced British thriller from writer-director J. Blakeson that is filled with some very surprising plot twists, as well as superb performances from Gemma Arterton, Martin Compston and Eddie Marsan.This is, indeed, one of the most intense, grittiest caper movies I've seen in years, and I cannot recommend it too highly. Michael B. Druxman
683, This film has a reflective undertow. It spends quite a long time casually making the journey to the infected zone. There is only the banter of a film-journalist and a blonde ( who he's tactfully trying to get off with) and stoic mexicans,almost taking for granted the monsters in their midst. There is deceptively good film-making going on because in other hands the script and plot would have become innane; it is more nuanced than it appears.It is a good film but my interest sagged probably because my idea of the film isn't its aims. For me, the film felt pregnant with metaphor. For example,  they are not monsters but an allegory for an inner state of mind etc....That is the film should have developed the meanings or possabilities of its reflective under-tow when the monsters appeared , but didn't. ( The female also became dumber in it )
684, I have issues with monster movies where the female lead is always dressed and looking sexy tousled, her hair and face just so, even as she sweats her way from one near-death to another. That was the funny part for me. I laughed. There is no chemistry between these two as they try to make their way home to the US from the alien-infected jungles of Mexico. Yes, the movie tries to make a social commentary about immigration and keeping the Mexicans out. Here, a huge wall is there to keep the aliens out, unsuccessfully, it turns out. I'll credit the film with not overdoing the scares. There is more threat of scare than actual scare. The aliens looks like giant shrimp, and while not entirely believable, they look okay for cheap special effects. The other effects are better, such as the wreckage left behind where the aliens have been rampaging. The script stinks, and the two lead actors are bad. Should you watch? Maybe. Just don't expect much.
685, This is simply the best of the Jackson Five and then some! Ths set and &quot;Pre-History, The Lost Steeltown Recordings&quot; are all the J-5 you'll ever need! The unreleased material is quite good (better than most of what is actually released these days)! &quot;Let's Have A Party&quot; perfectly captures the atmosphere of a 1970s afterschool dance party. &quot;It's Your Thing&quot; (with the incredibly sexy female background singers) is amazingly funky! &quot;Can't Get Ready For Losing You&quot; sounds like a first cousin to Boby Womack's &quot;I Can Understand It.&quot; J-5 fans rejoice!
686, I've been using Royal Purple engine oil for some time and they make a great product so I figured with my transmission fluid / filter change coming up, I'd switch it to Royal Purple as well. You may thing this is expensive but if you look at the manufacture transmission oil, it is actually more. Now not many go to the manufacture anyway but that brings me back to you get what you pay for so you can go much cheaper but you may pay for that in the transmission later. With a reputation like Royal Purple already has and my personal experience with their other products, I knew I could not go wrong here either. It's only been in the truck for a day but if there is anything other than the great performance I expect, I'll update this to let you know. I highly recommend this product.
687, I had seen this many years ago so I knew what to expect - if you don't know, don't expect something like "A Hard Days Night".  This is a very eccentric sales pitch for their new album at the time "Magical Mystery Tour".  The credits list Ringo as the director of photography, and maybe it's true - but he's a better drummer and human being than either a director or photographer.  Yet, there is much to appreciate in the historical content, and plenty to put a smile on the face of a fan.  I was disappointed in the video quality, it was apparently taken from a well used and faded film.  Plenty of scratches are visible, the colors are very faded, and scenes with the Beatles in white tuxes are terribly washed out.  HOWEVER, if you already have everything else of theirs, you may yet enjoy some of this video. If nothing else, see where the band "Death Cab for Cutie" got their name.
688, This is the best app, ever! Very easy to use. I have it on my kindle and my droid razr, so it's very easy to keep my food intake up to date. It has meals from most of the franchise restaurants that my husband and I frequent, as well as name brand items from the grocery store, so calories are super easy to enter.  It recognizes all the strength and aerobic exercises from my gym, so it's easy to enter exercise info. AND it even keeps track of my water intake! I love it!
689, This just popped into my review folder. I read this book many years ago but, Without Remorse is perhaps my favorite book of all time. This was written back when Clancy did all his own writing and research and it shows. While in the beginning you may ask yourself, why do I need to understand how to tie a bowline or a clove hitch for example, you will find out as you read that you are being lead down a path of understanding that makes the story rich and visual. For anyone who wants to know how John Clark began and how he became such a bad*ss this explains it all in the most brilliant work Tom Clancy has ever produced.
690, Clancy's works are exemplars of this school of suspense novel, which is largely driven by endless boring descriptions of infernal devices, catalogs of weaponry and technical specifications of their capabilities rather than character, dialog or even a credible plot. This particular book wastes nearly a thousand words describing how to make a pistol silencer -- which I suppose would be useful if I needed one or had the marine machine shop the hero uses to manufacture it. The plot is ridiculous and the hero is a dipstick who manages to get a woman killed because he is so stupid he drives with her into the ghetto to look for a dope dealer. It's idiotic, but that's what Hollywood wants these days. . .
691, FIRST OF ALL, ANY STEVIE WONDER THAT WAS RELEASED BEFORE 1980 IS A CLAWSSIC ALBUM, NO QUESTIONS ASKED, END OF DISCUSSION. THE MAN JUST OOZES TALENT, AND HAS SINCE HE WAS 11 YEARS OLD.  THIS ALBUM FINDS STEVIE REALLY STARTING TO FIND HIS OWN VOICE. DON'T GET ME WRONG, HE HAD RECORDED A LOT OF GREAT MATERIAL BEFORE THIS, BUT HERE HE IS FINALLY STARTING TO BREAK OUT, AND THIS ALBUM IS THE PRECURSOR TO "MUSIC OF MY MIND", "TALKING BOOK", INNERVISIONS", AND OTHER GREAT ONES TO COME OUT AFTER.
692, I've read most all of Mr. Clancy's novels and John Clark is probably my favorite character in all of his books. This novel explains Clark's whole existence in a very real and believable way so any reader that picks up a Jack Ryan or Rainbow Six Novel will be well informed not only about Mr. Clark but several other main characters in a lot of other novels as well without having to scratch there heads trying to figure out where these particular people come from. Plus it's a great standalone novel all by itself.

694, Part Death Wish and part Missing in Action, this tells the story of how former navy seal John Kelly became CIA operative John Clark.Set in the waning years of Vietnam, we meet recently widowed John Kelly as falls in love with a prostitute. She is brutally murdered by her drug running pimp and most of the book chronicles Kelly's quest for revenge, interspersed with the CIA's attempt to rescue american POWs from North Vietnam.It's not a bad book, but for most part it is just a standard revenge fantasy. Yes we'd all like to imagine what a trained special forces operative could do to street gangs, but the joy of reading a Tom Clancy book is to be immersed in the world of murky and clandestine geopolitics- and this book has very little of that.
695, THE PHOTO IS NOT OF THE PRODUCT ADVERTISED!!! The charger is wonderful and is, in fact, a "rapid charger" (unlike some advertised as such that take 3 hours in the car to get your charge back. I run THREE of these at once for my Droid and my two Blackberries and they both charge fully in under an hour when drained completely! It IS OEM and not a "fake" or "knock-off". This is a real, quality, Motorola accessory and I highly recommend it!
696, By one of the greatest albums of all time, forget in hip hop, "Me Against the World", I declared proudly that I was a big Tupac fan. Like "Life After Death" for Biggie, I just couldn't forsee how Tupac would top that masterpiece.With 3 solid #1 singles in a row, "California Love", "How Do U Want It" and "I Ain't Mad Atcha", Tupac was in another zone entirely. Astoundingly prolific, Tupac aka Makaveli aka The Master, began pumping out amazing material that would leave a legacy of over 75 million albums and counting.I honestly never gave "All Eyez on Me" the time it demanded and deserved. Now owning the CD and the incredible excellent promotional cost of the Mp3s, I will finally give it it's due.I'm going to defer to fans reviews of certain tracks to pay attention to and then write an addendum to this review. But I already know that it was great........now is about the time for intimacy.
697, A Song of Fire and Ice is one of the few fantasy series which becomes more enjoyable with each novel released.  A Dance with Dragons was a long time coming but the wait was worth it.About half of the main characters were missing from A Feast for Crows, so I thought that Dance would show the same period of time from different viewpoints instead of advancing the story. This is not the case.About 1/4th of Dance overlaps with the previous novel.  After that the overall plot advances and takes some interesting turns. Characters absent from Feast such as Jon Snow and Tyrion tell the majority of Dance, but Jaime, Arya, and others also have a few chapters.Martin has not dropped the ball. A Dance with Dragons is just as good as Game of Thrones, and even more fun to read.
698, Having used some of the more expensive products in my day, I have to say that Olay does a great job at keeping up with the competition while at the same time offering their products at affordable prices. I had originally been using a Vichy serum that had been working wonderfully, but the price was becoming far too steep to afford (over 40$!) - so I decided to give Olay Regenerist a try. Some things I've noticed since using it over the past year-1. Keeps my skin soft, but supple and tight.2. Feels velvety smooth on my skin, and makes it feel clean and light-weight.3. Some wrinkles forming along my brow have completely disappeared.4. My skin looks and feels awesome!Overall, you just can't argue with real results, and when the price is right, you've got nothing to lose here  - Highly recommended, give it a try and you'll love it!
699, Based on the date of the series, it appears to be a one time thing. The series is well acted, and does depict actual events (or so it says in the overview). I am finding myself drawn more and more to the British TV series. I believe the British story tellers can make something out of nothing. Our U.S. studios can take a lesson from these shows. While American film and TV is dependent upon too much money to produce, most British TV and Movies are made on a very small budget. The British productions depend on acting and story line. That is something the American story tellers should try.
700, One of the most useful and frequently used apps on my fire HD. It has easily understandable sections for breakfast,lunch dinner, and snacks and will set your daily calorie allowance once you enter weight,height etc.It also helps to track how many calories you use and has a wide database of calorific values of food from U.K. supermarkets.The whole concept is simple and easy,one word of caution maybe,if you don't want to count calories then this isn't' for you but otherwise YOU HAVE to get it.
701, I don't even know how to express how excited I am to have found this product.  I was having flashes at least 6 times a day and night sweats as well as being a bit on the mean and moody side, but I am symptom free now and have been for at least a month now.  I do use a progesterone (natural) creme too, but it never worked as well alone as it works with the promensil.  The promensil my be just enough too, but I don't dare change anything now that I am &#34;me&#34; again!  Give this a shot, you will be quite happy!
702, This is the second time I put this in my old car (1997 Honda Accord). It improve the shiftly slight faster than before  and I can feel the torque is better too. On the pass, it take long while before the car can pick up. Now, I can feel better pulling. Finally, I have to send my car to my mechanic to have valve tune up. Because it haven't done any tune up for over 100,000 miles. Let me check it out are there better return, I shall keep post for any one who are interest on it. Thanks
703, I am an exclusive bfing mom, so when it got close to time to go back to work I started working with baby to take his milk from a bottle. I have always used the Avent brand. The nipple is wide enough for baby as to hopefully prevent nipple confusion. But when I tried giving my son a bottle he sucked a few seconds then started to cough. I started to play with the nipple by pointing it sideways and I barely squeezed it and the milk came out quite effortlessly. I also turned it upside down and instead of a slow drip is was a stream. After waiting a few days I tried my son again on the bottle with the other nipple and the same problem arose the milk was just coming out too fast. I ended having to use a different brand entirely. Now though at almost four months my little guy taked this nipple like a champ.
704, This is the dishwashing soap I used most of the time, because the company gets good marks on the Good Guide website for health and environment.  There have apparently been some social controversies around the corporate governance and marketing practices, but the company is still in the top 15% of all companies surveyed.  The lavender scent smells good, and the product gets my dishes clean without killing my hands.  There are a couple of concerning ingredients that can cause contact allergies, but I didn't have issues with them.  There's also a small amount of 1,2-BENZISOTHIAZOLIN-3-ONE, but it's below the threshold believed to cause problems.
705, I was recently in the hospital for a while and dug the socks they gave me. They were pretty comfortable, and definitely kept me from slipping (I was told that I had to wear them so the hospital would avoid a lawsuit). My parents have gotten at the age where I am concerned about their fragility, so I saw these and thought they would be a nice way to avoid any injuries.... and kind of gave them as a gag gift.Well, it's a good thing that they come in a giant bundle, because these things fall apart pretty much immediately. Walking around the house causes the pads to come off the sock. The hospital socks have a different material on the bottom to create the grip padding --- what these give you is more or less a sticker on a sock.I do NOT recommend these for anyone that things they're getting anything functional.
706, I am very impressed with the results which happened after taking this just one week. After doing some research about safe methods to reduce hot flashes, I came upon this product. There are many studies done mostly in Europe, and they are very positive. I had 5 to 6 hot flashes every night, robbing me of a good night sleep. Now I have maybe 1 hot flash every 3-4 nights. This really worked for me. I will be taking this for a very long time. Studies also show that this supplement helps retain bone density, and helps with mood swings.
707, I still use the square aluminum jack stands and I guess it really all depends on the brand you have or something cause these pads needed to be about 1/8&#34; bigger to fit mine so I was not pleased with that though I didn't have anything to block up my tongue when parked so these worked for that I guess. They need to make these things a TINY bit bigger then they can put a picture of a basic jack stand on the front .... till they do it;s really false advertising cause they do not fit either sets of my regular square aluminum jack stands.
708, Two years ago I lost about 40 pounds using Dr Oz's Sharecare tools. But my goal had been to lose 50.  Recently Consumer Reports recommended this app so I decided to try it.  I am very impressed.  The human interface is very easy to use.  Navigation was a little tricky at first but once I got the hang of it, it became a snap.  It takes very little time to update it after each meal or even to use it as a planning tool. The database of exercises is a little skimpy, but usable.  I like the choice of formats for the reports, especially the daily/weekly listing of nutrients.  And best of all, I have already lost 2.5 pounds!  Maybe I found it so easy to use because of my previous experience, but I don' t think so.  I find this to be a vastly superior product.
709, Product delivered on description.  Easy to use, install, and hands free.  It says it's not approved for use at the top of the stairs because the only gates approved for use at the top of the stairs are hardware mounted ones, so I just put it in the hallway right before the stairs and works great.  Although it's so sturdy, if there wasn't the rule about needing to be hardware mounted it would work for stairs.  I'm not sure how old the people's children are who said they can open this gate, but mine is 1 and there's no way he's strong enough.  In order to open the gate you have to have a good amount of leg strength that I wouldn't anticipate younger kids having.
710, Very disappointing to learn that this show enjoyed only 1 season.  Does not speak well for the American viewing public if they were not willing to make the effort to follow a somewhat complicated story-line that ultimately reveals itself &#34;in toto&#34; with each progressive episode.  The character of Sean Walker was expertly cast, as was Sophia, Pres. Martinez, Agent Lee, Nat'l Security Dir. Sterling, Michael Buchanan, etc...  The transporting of the entire planet during the last episode was ingenious & unexpected.
711, I have researched every gate on the market at this point.  So far we are extremely happy with this gate.  We wanted pressure mounted gates but I was concerned that the opening of this particular gate would not be wide enough for my husband.  I thought that he would have to turn sideways to get through the door and would not like it once used on a regular basis.  So far we are very satisfied customers and my husband can walk straight through the opening so the width meets our needs better than I anticipated.
712, This is great!It fits perfectly and securely over the side of the changing table. I like that the side holders are removable, because I only ended up using one of them. I was leery about this, since it's plastic and only cost ~$12, but it is AWESOME! Also, I got it from Amazon two days earlier than it was estimated to arrive (bonus!!).It is a very solid plastic - it is not flimsy at all. It's easy to pull out the diapers one-handed (from the bottom slot of the holder). I recommend this MUCH more than a hanging cloth "diaper holder" - this organizer is SO much more useful! It also puts the wipes right there - easy to grab!Highly recommended!
713, If you haven't reas WITHOUT REMORSE yet, then you don't really understand how good of a writer Clancy is.Set during the early '70s, this novel is the backsttory for John Kelly AKA Clark, the CIA operative who figures extensively throughout Clancy's Jack Ryan series. As much a morality play as adventure, this book explores Clark's life from happily-married Navy veteran to CIA operative. Clark battles his demons, both real and imaginary until he is forced by circumstance to risk it all.The book is technically accurate, and excellent in both character and plot development. It's a page turner and never predictable. I've reread it several times and continue to enjoy the nunaces that escape one on a first read. It would be a great movie if Hollywood wouldn't butcher it like, say, SUM OF ALL FEARS.You won't regret buying it.
714, Each episode of &#34;London Hospital&#34; dramatizes two or three health or social problems that were current at the beginning of the twentieth century in the East End of London and for which scientific knowledge was very limited...and considerably less than what was known and available one hundred years later. The encounters between dedicated doctors and especially nurses and their mostly poor patients occur before any system of socialized medicine and at a time when several medical conditions---pregancy, attempted suicide---brought with them not only much social baggage but also the threat of police intervention. Many of the scenes are tense and several quite difficult to watch. The grimness is offset by the comfort we can derive from the spectacular advances in moderm medicine in developed countries...yet &#34;London Hospital&#34; also conveys the feel of emergency services in developing countries today.
715, We used Avent with our first child, and had that for our daughter too. However, she had a lot of issues with gas so we tried different bottles. After asking around we landed on these, and were thrilled. She uses a medium flow nipple at 10 months, and she hardly has gas issues anymore. That being said, if you can check out local stores as they were half the price of what they are here on Amazon. I love you Amazon, but your prices are getting steep.There has been one bottle that got a crack in it, but I even dropped a bottle on to our concrete floor and it did not break. Also, for formula these bottles are very narrow in the neck. I ended up making my own funnel with an old breastpump attachment, which makes it a lot less messy.
716, What can I say about this classic hip hop album that hasnt already been said!!!!!  to be honest..... not much.  But this is my Favorite 2pac album ever!!!!  In my opinion, 2pac isnot only the greatest rap artist ever but also the greatest writer in hip hop!!!!!  This album is just an example of what he can do with his incredible talents in a short amount of time.  Every song on here gets at least 4.5 stars......  I would go in more detail... but so much has been said by so many other people........ Its the GREATEST!!!!!
717, And They did land on Mars, and make themselves shelter, and food.  And they did study and learn and shape this new world to thier will.  And it was good.This book is rich in imagery, science, personality, and realism.  I was so thoroughly pulled in by this book that I read the entire trillogy straight through on the momentum of this first book.  This is the best of the series I belive, but the other two books are still worth it to complete this epic tale.  They start in Antartica, during training and final selection of the first hundred to land on mars and build a rich tapestry to start this trillogy from.The Charachters are full of personality and realism, the setting richly described, and you'll find yourself pulled to Mars and dreaming of the day when we really will land there and set up a colony and eventually a new nation.
718, First off, I started using this product back in the 70s, but ended up over the the years buying all the new and greatest brands, but ultimately came back to this old stand-by, because I happened to be watching ABC's Good Morning America news show one morning, and they had a beauty consultant on which had gone through all the top rated mascara brands including this one. Ultimately, their tests couldn't prove any of the other more expensive brands were any better than this old stand-by.  And the reported indicated that it was more feasible to use this brand. So, I will start using this product again, and stop wasting my money on the other brands which I personally couldn't see any improvement over this one.
719, Todd is a master crafter of catchy songs, an innovative musician/engineer, and his unmistakable voice (full, thick and soothing) is a treat to hear. On this DVD, most of the songs from "Nearly Human" and other favorites are captured live. The band consists of guitar, bass, drums, two keyboardists, sax, trumpet, percussion, three female backing vocals and Todd. If you want to see Todd jam you may be disappointed since he only plays lead on "Unloved Children", solo acoustic guitar on "Love of the Common Man", and electric guitar on "Love in Action". On this tour, he focused on singing and let his incredibly tight band provide the music.The video is clear; the editing, tastefully done, shows the enthusiasm of the musicians. Audio choices are DD 5.1 and stereo. Both sound great, but the stereo mix sounds tighter and better defined. No extras or bonus features are provided but with an intense performance like this you don't miss them.
720, If one could own only five or ten discs from the 1970's this had better be one of them.  &quot;Innervisions&quot; is a astoundingly good album.  There is no filler here, everything is lean and mean.  Of course, the Red Hot Chili Peppers covered &quot;Higher Ground&quot; years ago, but Stevie's version is the only one that sounds right to me.  Also listen to &quot;All in love is fair&quot; and &quot;Visions&quot;-gorgeous songs.  On a side note, jazz saxophonist Joshua Redman covered &quot;Visions&quot; beautifully on his release &quot;Timeless Tales for Changing Times.&quot;  Essential.
721, I really like this boonie hat. I had one I wore for years while backpacking. It keeps the sun from burning your ears,neck,and face. Another great thing about it is, if you are really hot you can put it in the creek and get it soak and wet. If will keep your head cool for a bit, and doing this won't ruin the hat at all. The last one I owned I bought it from an army surplus store. I had no complaints about it, I just lost it. This one seems to be a lot better quality. The price is great, and the quality is even better.
722, This is sooo much better than fat secret which I was using on my phone. The Kindle Fire Version of fat secret is crappy and does not mirror the online version at all. I like how simple this app is. It's not trying to get you to join all kinds of communities and have online weight loss buddies which is not for me. It simply helps me track my food according to my goals. PERIOD. You can take advantage of other features but it doesn't feel like too much more than a food diary. The graphics are minimal and clean so it actually feels like a notepad. The only thing I'd change with the software is the ability to edit food once in you diary with a better edit button. Over all I feel like this is the app to use if you simply want to track your eating for weight loss or nutrition.
723, Have any of the readers noticed the use of as well.  Author uses as well a lot.  There is a description of something with an additional item added with as well attached.  It is like me saying I have a Toyota and a Chevrolet as well.  Not a problem...just noticed.  I am very pleased and engrossed with these books.  My complaint would be along the line of purchasing the 1st 4 as a set at a price higher than the similar set with the first five a set (5 books at a lower price than the subsequent set of 5).  Also book 6 is late.
724, I am short & worse yet, I have short legs. Most shorts are just too long & wind up making me look fat and squatty. these are short, so if you have  really big legs, don't get them. but if you have average or slim legs, these are ideal!  Comfy, pull on quickly, launder well. They are so inexpensive you can do your outside work and not worry about ruining them. they are made, I believe, for younger women, but I'm over 50 and I think I look nice in them. (I don't have a lot of flab or cellulite).  Good for canoeing, lawn care, hiking, bike-riding, walking or just about anything in the summer . It's HOT down here, and the very light material allows you to do work without the shorts giving off extra heat (like blue jean or thicker shorts)
725, I first bought this product from my manicurist, just to be polite. She insisted. My nails would chip and she politely insisted that I try this product. OK, OK, I tried them all from the drugstores and was skeptical about this one too. I'd use it as clear nail polish, or so I thought. The effects of this stuff blew me away -- it really, really, really, really works. Really. I noticed my nails looked a lot better -- I was shocked. I usually don't wear polish, and the looks of wearing this alone looked great -- it sort of "wears off" or gets absorbed, so you never have to remove it -- just reapply. I'm active, athletic, and this stuff is awesome.
726, I desperately hated it when my favorite maybelline lash stiletto voluptuous waterproof mascara ran out. So i went to walmart and looked at their mascaras. At my walmart, lash stiletto was about $8 so i decided to try something cheaper. So i quickly grabbed the cheapest maybelline mascara i saw, which was the great lash (it was $4.88). I didn't really expect much from it, but after using it twice, i actually fell in love with this mascara. I like to use one coat and thats all i need. My lashes look fuller, darker, and still looks natural and soft. way better than my former mascara. This is my ultimate favorite. I love it! :D
727, One can only hope that this is a series which out-lasts the &#34;network's&#34; decision-makers.  There hasn't been enough of this sort of entertainment in years, which is comedic, and yet not so blatantly offensive as to alienate a prospective audience base.  Betty White has been a cornerstone of character-based comedy for a great many years, and the entire cast complement one another to the &#34;nth&#34; degree.  Can't help but hope they've got many more seasons ahead of them!  Jane Leeves has a storied career, and a production company she formed with Peri Gilpin (Roz, from &#34;Frasier&#34;) and is an accomplished comedic, as well as dramatic actress.  Wendie Malick and Valerie Bertinelli's talent speaks for itself!  There is also an unannounced surprise guest star in nearly every episode which serves to add to the hilarity.  You go, girls!
728, There really isn't a whole lot I can tell you about THE DISAPPEARANCE OF ALICE CREED.  I happened on to it, started watching it...expected to lose interest...and then kept thinking, "Oh, wow, that's different."What got me to start watching was Gemma Arterton, a "Bond girl" from the last 007 entry, QUANTUM OF SOLACE.  She's gorgeous and very watchable.  At the beginning of this film, she's snatched off a street, cuffed, gagged, hooded and dragged into a sound-proof apartment.  She's also stripped and redressed.And just when you think you're going to lose interest..."Wow, that's different."So I'm not going to discuss anymore about this interesting, twisting little film of only three characters.Just check it out.
729, This is a very convenient device, its small and easily fits into your pocket.  Charges everything I throw at it. Not literally.  the laser pointer is a very cool feature especially if you have cats.  the flashlight also is a nice feature although i wish it were brighter.  Extremely easy to use, and does a great job charging my ipads and iphone.  I love the fact it small enough to go into my pocket and not be too big and bulky.  i bought one loved it so much and bought two more to keep the kids ipads charging.  i would highly recommend this product.  great bang for your buck when stacked up to competitors products.
730, This app is extremely helpful in keeping track of calories! At first I wondered how I could possibly keep track of all of the calories I consumed in a day, and then I found the search option in this app. You can search for and find many different types of food whether it is fast food, homemade food, or ingredients to food. It's extremely simple to keep track of the calories in everything you eat, as long as you have internet access. It doesn't take long to find anything, and best of all it's free.This is a great, and extremely helpful app for keeping track of calories and can even keep track of calories burned from exorcise! I highly recommend it for anyone who is trying to lose weight, or maintain a healthy weight.
731, I love this app! It combines two essential tools for me. I use the food diary and database many times during the day.it helps both be aware of my intake AND keep me honest!  The calories guide works with my  Fitbit to help me balance my diet with my exercise.So far I've lost 16 pounds and am encouraged to continue.  By this time in every other diet plan I've tried I would have given up. Well worthwhile and works on PC, smartphone, android and Kindle Fire.
732, I truely enjoyed this book, and I am very much hooked into the story now and cannot wait to read the next book. I can understand the frustration some readers feel about this book, as it does go back in time from the end of the 4th book.  In the version I have been reading, the first chapter is a repeat of a chapter in the 4th book. I did groan internally when I started the book and realized we went back in time, but decided to give it a try.  I'm glad I did because the chapters in the book helped move the story forward, and were intersesting to read. After reading them, I think they were important to the story's development.  The only thing I'm sad about is that I do not have the 6th book yet to read.
733, I like the entire Mrs. Meyer line since it is environmentally responsible and  does a good job, but this soap is fantastic. I've been using it for a couple of years now. It is gentle to the skin, has this great subtle scent, and is one of the few soaps that can tame the smell of onions after I've been slicing and dicing.The scent is floral yet subtle. It reminds me of a sunny day in my garden.My husband is pretty much anti-scent and avoids anything perfumy or highly scented like the plague, but he thinks this falls under the parameter of gender friendly.I use this primarily in the kitchen and the powder room, but it is good anywhere in the house.
734, I watched it to the end. Who ever wrote this had no insite into human behavior. The blond was good looking had a presence. And beat Hilary in acting but that was not saying much. the story line was extremely weak. The blond should have knowin his big mouth friend was talking. there was no other way they would know about him. I mean there are a hell of a lot of blond men with pony tails. lol And he had a big mouth. I also noticed that he had no gun shot wound in the pool scean > Bad writing Bad directing. And the minute a bad guy came on the scean you knew he was bad. The only knowen people where the bad guys as usual in a bad movie.
735, I brought this product to my mechanic to see if it is advisable to add to my coolant while at service.  He told me never use with aluminum radiators.  Also there is nothing wrong with my coolant system so he flushed the system with distill water and added Toyota Red coolant to a mix approximately 50/50.The mechanic added, only Royal Purple product he might use is brake fluid for its color so when you flush the brake system you can easier to tell the fluid is clear when purple fluid starts breeds out.I was laughing reading those reviews of swearing up and down how good all the Royal Purple products are.  Those clowns are very likely working for or owning Royal Purple.
736, After waiting 5 years for this book, I really expected better. It's 1000 pages long but spends much of its page count adrift on a sea of stories that could have been scrapped in favor delivering the book earlier (and shorter). The Meereen story is one I would have preferred to see resolved in 50 pages. So too the Stannis story.Instead, we got hundreds of pages of Mereen and Stannis, and only a few brief drives on the key stories: Bran, Arya, and Dany + dragons. Painful. What's worse, the Jon Snow story foundered, making us wait painfully through more hundreds of pages that could easily have been summarized in much less, without sacrificing any story integrity.All in all, I am disheartened. This book feels rushed (kinda weird, five years later) and I fear GRRM has lost the handle on the story.Here's hoping The Winds of Winter turns out better -- and quicker.
737, Can I just say that this is an awesome film. It's the [best]. It's whatever good thing you want to call it. I enjoyed it immensely back in the day I will always. I remember my brothers and I would watch this movie all the time, even my older sister who was grown and moved out the house. She used to laugh everytime at the "Come Together" part. Also, we even named our dog "Skipper" after the dog in the movie. I remember me and my brother would dance around the house to the Young version of Bad and smooth criminal and all of that. This was an amazing movie and I will always love it. I thank Michael for making this film it's great and I will never grow tired of it. We used to rent this video all the time from the video store and we even bought the Sega Genesis game of this film! I love it.
738, If you had asked me 3 months ago, I would've rated this 5 stars. However, in the last month the device doesn't charge. I've had it look like it was charging with the lights going but then no actual charge. Or it just doesn't do anything no matter what charger I plug it into. This is really disappointing because I only bought it 5 months ago.Prior to that, it had been working great. I could easily get 2.5 full charges of my iPhone 5. It was perfect for travel. I could use it all day, charge it overnight and it was ready to go again the next day.
739, It was a awful lot of flashback in the in this first episode; I almost gave up seriouly. It got me to thinking is this a apocalypse or what? So for the most part it started out pretty slow. I'm all for post apocalypse movies, or especially something; I can believe that would actually take place no matter if it's super natural or not. But, I can see why this show didn't get picked up for it's next season to many flashbacks the 2nd episode same thing.
740, We bought this tub after our son outgrew his standard baby tub because we were nervous about putting him in our deep jetted bathtub. It's been a great item and our son LOVES his baths more than ever. The way the tub is designed works out perfectly for our wiggly toddler - it "holds" him in place so that he doesn't slip under. The drain is my only complaint - we use this tub by placing it in our "adult" tub and the way the drain is situated we have to lift the Eurotub slightly to get it to drain (or place something under it to prop it up) -also: the drain cap should've been designed to open in the other direction so the natural water flow when draining wouldn't close the cap so easily. Two tiny prices to pay for a great tub - I would definitely recommend it and I would purchase it again.
741, This is a complex, thoughtful and thought-provoking book. The science (what I can judge of it) is relatively plausible, and, in multiple fields, well researched and presented. But beyond the science, the human drama that unfolds is absolutely riveting.Robinson develops a large number of characters without ever losing the narrative thread of his story. The plots and sub-plots all intertwine and interact beautifully. And the story he unfolds, showing the growth of different philosophical groups, the financial and political struggles, and the human level of impact, is absolutely riveting.Big and complex as the book admittedly is, I could barely put it down. I will necessarily be finishing the entire trilogy, and will definitely look at anything this author has written...
742, Update: I originally gave this a one star rating. See below. However after almost a week, it just kicked in one day. Once that happens, it works as well as the wipe on kind; without the elbow grease!Original Review:I'm a big Rain-X fan. After reading a lot of positive reviews I bought this. Like another one star reviewer, I read and followed the instructions faithfully. Right off the bat it didn't work. "OK," I thought, "Maybe it just takes time for it to kick in." So I kept "washing" my windshield raining or not - going to work, driving around town, etc.. The water doesn't slide off when sprayed on the windshield and it doesn't slide off when it's raining. I feel that I should add another voice to let people know that at least for some of us, it doesn't work at all. Not a bit.Go with the wipe on original.
743, this game is so much fun i played it for more than an hour.you have to jump the squriells birds blades and if you get the bubble you keep it until a squirell blade or bird hits the bubble that you got will pop.this game is very fun and my cousins got me into it.i play everyday and in those days i always get new highscores.this game is great to get so if dont know if you dont want to get just read mine review and you will really love it.guess what this is free! i was really this game is so fun and its free the backflip games are always the best like papertoss that is another really great game but if youre wondering if you should get this game you really should get thank you for reading my review and i hope you like this game!
744, I just got them and they are actually lighter than I expected.  It was like slipping a glove on.  They feel great.I will start breaking them in tomorrow, but It is not going to take a lot of time.  They are super.  I have a wide foot with a high instep.  No problems there.  I have had Vasque and a couple others.  I love my Vasque from 1972, but they seemed to have slipped in the styling and manufacturing.  These look rugged and feel like slippers.  We'll see in the next couple of days.
745, This app is an excellent one, as I have already started losing weight since I started tracking calories once again.  Sure a LOT easier than the pen and paper method I used a year and a half ago when I lost 35 lbs!  When I stopped counting I gained 1/2 of the weight back. :(  ~~~ Seems like calorie counting is the ONLY way that I ever lose weight.  And this app is even FREE!!I also really, really like the way this allows you to look up lots of different items, and I just discovered that that part works on most foods offline! SUPER!  I'm impressed!
746, I was looking for a light-weight, quick-drying, sun-protective shirt for my husband for a trip to Africa.  The cost of "safari" shirts was outrageous.  This "fishing" shirt had all the advantages at a fraction of the price.  The only reason a gave it a 4-star instead of a 5-star is some quality problems.  The buttonholes are not completely cut open.  I had to pull out my seam ripper and finish cutting them to get the buttons through.  It's fixable, it doesn't detract from the shirt after I made the fix, but I would appreciate a little better quality work on the shirt.
747, With the exception of South Park and the Simpsons, this is the best comedy on TV.  In a world bound by PC and 'standards and practices', it's about the best it can be.  Ms. White is a timeless source of unexpected humor.  You know she's part of the cast, reading a script; yet, her quips come as a surprise.  We just can't accept that older people have a sense of humor and an agile mind.The composite cast is perfect, with Wendy Malick, Valerie Bertineeli, and Jane Leeves as three friends who are constantly at each other's throats...but in a mild, harmless, PC way.The first season was very short but had no filler or bad shows.  If you've seen the series, you understand and will buy this.  If you HAVEN'T seen the show, then sample an episode.  I'm sure that you will want this collection after a taste of the series.
748, I love law and order Los Angeles though my first, always and number 1 love is the original Law and Order. Same concept different players and some big name players I might add. As we all know law and Order always took from the headlines and made their twist to it, well it's no Different in LA where at times it gives story lines from the entertainment world. I do like the show, I feel it could be a bit stronger after watching some of the episodes I have yet to know each character. And I know they are probably now and then going to switch people sometimes I like and get use to a character and then they bring in someone new for you to get use to. But I would keep watching.MAN I miss Jerry Orbach. He was real, you could relate and he had his humor that flowed right into the Law and Order shows, that made you love watching him and law and order. R.I.P. There are also a lot of good actors who were apart of this franchise.
749, I bought two of these to help make keeping my otter box case on when needed to use the speaker/aux cable.The first cable worked for about 1 hour before it began to fray and separate.  The second one only gave audio out of one side.  You could pull the cable out slightly and get both channels (sides), but if your gizmo (phone, tablet, mp3 player) moves the slightest then it stops working on both sides.The other bad thing is the static it creates when in use (aux or headphones).The item is junk and I would avoid unless you like throwing away money.
750, while amazon normally has a very updated and accurate fitment chart, the one for this item was off. the item was as described, and the picture was accurate of what the item looked like, however fitment showed it would fit my 02 Tahoe with the 5.3 L engine. this is not true for one reason.  - Flex Fuel - if you have a Flex Fuel 5.3 engine the filter is VERY different. you not only need a special tool to release the different type of 'quick disconnect' but you also have to get a different filter. Make sure you do your research prior to ordering from the more accurate fitment charts from the actual brand's website. If you don't have flex fuel on your engine, this should be the right one, and its just a matter of purging the fuel system, and breaking free 2 flare nuts on either side. the change only takes about 10 minutes. make sure you know what you need before ordering.
751, I totally agree with the Agitated Reviewer.Justin probably has only another 5-10 years of life left and this happens.What must Stevie have been thinking off? Back in 1973 when he made this album Justin had been doing this kind of stuff 10-15 years before him.Also the good thing about Justin is the way he keeps his young appearance. If I look like him when I'm 70 I'll be a happy man. I know this is all history now but its about time someone like the Agitated Reviewer told the true undistorted facts.
752, Works as advertised.  Only problem I have had is that sometimes it never goes out of solid red after connecting to the motorcycle, and if I unplug it for a few hours, and then plug it back in, it seems to then go through the correct cycle, ending in green.  This could be the fault of the battery, but I can't know, so I am giving it a 4.5 stars (rounded down from 5 to 4 in this case).  I also wish the cord were a few feet longer and they used multiple LED's to show status.
753, This could have been much better.  I wanted to give it two stars, but John Hurt, Anna Massey and Elijah Wood give a good performance, as do the other cast members, hence the three star rating.  The story is all over the place in the desire, I think, to create the illusion of enigma.  It is enigmatic only from the standpoint the the audience is deprived of important aspects of the plot.If you follow your &#34;gut feeling&#34; in the beginning, you will find that you are right on target when the &#34;truth&#34; is finally revealed at the end.  So, okay in some respects and blessed infuriating in others.  Not my cup of tea.
754, This is the weakest book of his I have read, and that is about thirty MacLean novels.  I understand that he passed away prior to this book being  published and that is was compiled posthumously.  While admittedly not all  of his books are great, I don't feel this is up to snuff with any of the  others.  Don't make this your first MacLean book and unless you feel the  desire to read every one of his books like I choose to, take a pass on it.  I am unwilling to touch any of the Alistair MacNeill books written using  MacLeans notecards because I feel those are apt to be pretty weak too, and  no one ever seems to duplicate the originals.  If you are going to give a  couple of MacLean novels a try, go for &quot;Where Eagles Dare&quot;,  &quot;Puppet on a Chain&quot;, &quot;Bear Island&quot;, &amp; &quot;Ice  Station Zebra&quot;.
755, For Any Long Time Fan of Diana Ross, there is no need to review the base of what makes up this Lp. However what is so great is that once again Andy Skrow and George Solomon have put together a fan's dream, a complete look at the Lp! On this double cd, the tracks that were left out and the Alternate Version's of songs from the Project are all included. Like ALL of their past releases there are wonderful liner notes and alternate photo's from the photo shoot. Supreme Job Guys!!!!!NEXT!!!!!!!!
756, I've been looking for a reasonably-priced antioxidant serum, and this is the best drugstore version I've found. As someone with combination skin, I don't generally use a moisturizer, however this product provides all the moisture I need. It has an incredibly lightweight/silky feel on my skin, and dries to a matte finish. I use it on my entire face, specifically around the eye region.The combination of B vitamins and amino-peptides is great for my skin, and I wear it under my sunscreen daily. As a man, I like that the product is fragrance-free, and just makes my skin just look &#34;healthy.&#34;
757, This is gonna be a short and sweet review, so...Maiden England is Iron Maiden's England gig duirng "Seventh Son of a Seventh Tour" in 1989. I downloaded Maiden England via Ares.ME is one of their best, IMO. It starts with Moonchild, and ends with Iron Maiden. I'm even surprised they performed "Killers"! The stage theme is an Iceberg. You gotta love the slideshow at the beginning, and Bruce's "Teddy Bear" thing on stage before "Infinite Dreams"!This is a must-have for any maiden fan. Up the irons!
758, I purchased this for my brother's upcoming birthday. He's a diehard metal fan and especially loves Metallica so I'm sure he'll love this. For the price, I thought this was a great buy. The t-shirt is not overly thick which makes it perfect for hot summery weather, or it could always be worn under a sweater in cooler seasons. The picture on the front looks like its firmly in place, no peeling or anything, though I hope it remains the same after going through the wash. There's also a list of song titles from the album on the back. All in all, I think this is value for money.
759, This is an excellent value. You can charge your iPod/iPhone from a 12 volt lighter plug or with the ac to usb charger. A handy retractable usb cord is included in the kit. Works very well with my iPod Touch. The 12 volt charger keeps my iPod's charge topped up and let's me listen to an entire audiobook without losing power just as the story gets interesting. Both chargers also work well with other devices that charge through the usb port. I charge my bluetooth headset and my extra battery packs with these chargers.
760, My son moved to this tub when he was about 5 months old and too big for his whale tub. I love that there's the option to let them recline or sit up straight. While my son is sitting up with no problems now and can catch himself (he's 7 months) I still recline him while I wash his hair so that I can avoid getting shampoo in his eyes. I have never used the drain feature as I just tip the tub over when I'm done. This is a great tub for babies too big for the sink but too small for the real tub! I highly recommend! I also recommend theOXO Tot Tub Kneeling Mat, Blue- it really saves your knees while you bathe your child.
761, This is still my favorite Fall album.  It's the one I reach for automatically whenever I feel the need to hear Mark Smith drawling-uh like a madman, and to stomp my foot along with one of the baddest rhythym sections in rock while they pummel their way through classics like Cruiser's Creek, My New House, or Petty Thief Lout.This album goes all over the place, from spaced-out experiments with tape recorders and ambient noise, to goofy rants about not being able to get a beer on a flight.  Immensely satisfying racket!
762, Take a young, striving Grover Washington Jr. in 1972...now add producer Creed Taylor and mix in artists like Ron Carter, Bob James, Richard Tee, Eric Gale, add strings and background vocals and you have an ensemble to end them all!With Grover Washington Jr. center stage...  NOW, take these amazing talents and have them play Inner City Blues, Georgia, Mercy, Mercy Me, Ain't No Sunshine, Until It's Time For You To Go, and I Loves You Porgy.This is one of Grover Washington Jr.'s finest, yet funky, and complex works.  Creed Taylor (a musical magician) had obviously been an inspiration as a producer.  In Grover's later works, it shows.  This one is so very soulfully deep, it is not to be missed for any Grover collector!
763, I am very happy with the quality and apparent sturdiness of my new Rainkist umbrella. However, I am a little disappointed with the automatic mechanism.  My old umbrella that bit the dust in a massive windstorm was automatic, so I wanted another one with that same feature. My disappointment came when I found that the umbrella does not auto-close as well as auto-open. My husband has an umbrella that also closes with the push of a button just as it opens with the push of a button. Since this was not exactly a cheap umbrella, I really expected that it would open both ways. This should have been explained in the description of the item.
764, The sleeves on this tall size shirt are too short. The sleeves on this shirt are not like the picture where the sleeves look as though they are also tall sized. Its obvious that the factory just sewed on the regular sized sleeves onto this shirt, not a longer version as you would expect wih a tall size.The additional length on the body of the shirt is actually too long, much longer than a Carhart large tall t shirt for reference. The body of the shirt is too narrow, this shirt is more of a medium extra tall for the body then its a large regular at the shoulders and sleeves. Why does it matter? its just a t shirt right?........well as someone who wears t shirts everyday, for both work and off, such a simple garment actually is very important to get right. Not slim, not baggy, again, not slim, if I want slim i'll buy a smaller size.Will keep trying to find a proper fitting large tall. This shirt is not the one.
765, The early 70's seemed to be the peak period for truly inventive soul music - Stevie Wonder's Innervisions, Curtis Mayfield's Superfly, and this album - probably the best of the three. This was a period when soul musicians  went away from the Motown formula, integrated jazz and more abstract  melodies into their music and writing lyrics about what was going on in  black America and even in most cases, America as a whole.  What's Going On  is a perfect album - beautifully constructed, and instrumentally  adventurous. It has a soulful, funky groove that runs through it, and the  lyrics, pertaining to war, the breakdown of spirituality and the  environment still sound pretty fresh today.  Marvin Gaye has woven a  musical tapestry here - integrating horns, flutes, strings, and layers of  percussion, and with his timeless words, it comes down to one thing -  perfection.
766, Bought this audio dongle for the sole purpose of using it in conjunction with my iPad Mini's LifeProof Fre's deep recessed headphone port & my Monster iSport Victory right-angle jack.  The jack's housing fits & passes Left & Right audio channels but I can't control a fully-functional in-line controls of my Monster iSport Victory in-ear earphones.  No matter how much I twist the connection to make it connect, I couldn't use the in-line controls.  The cable seems thin & I'm concern that it might not last as well.  iPad Mini on iOS 6.1.3 while the iPad 2 is on iOS 7.0 if it matters.  I'll update this review once I get the chance to try it with my Beats MixR headphones (in-line control cable also have a right-angle jack).
767, This show has a lot of potential, and fulfills some of it.It achieves a level of gritty believability due to the gravitas of the main stars. There's a lot of &#34;Oh, I love that actor!&#34; moments, and the cast is culled from Tier 1 and 2 stars from other tv shows that you'll be delighted to get to visit with again.Coherent story, believable drama, a fun sci fi series.If you're not into SciFi, I don't think you'll like The Event.If you're into SciFi, you might appreciate the several-levels-bump-up from writing acting and directing from shows like Stargate.
768, My son had his first bath in this tub. It's a bit large for a newborn. I had to use my forearm for support and bathe him with my other hand. The second time I used it, I used one of the mesh beds from another bath with this set. My son was in heaven.There's plenty of room in the tub. It's easy to drain. I usually drain a bit of the water mid-bath and add more water to make sure I'm getting all of the soap off.He is now 10-weeks and loves splashing his hands in the water. He looks forward to bath time.
769, I live in Boston, and this winter, we got pummeled with ice and snow, and I love to walk -- but not on ice -- so I decided to give these a try. They actually do work on ice! However, psychologically, it's still daunting to step onto a sheet of ice. It was hard to get over that fact and not walk really carefully and slowly. Also, you can walk on dry pavement with these, but it's not comfortable to do so. I found myself putting these on and taking them off again, which is of course a bit tedious and annoying. I suggest getting these if you live somewhere where it is completely icy/snowy for miles, or you just need to run to grab the mail walking on an icy driveway, but in the city, where you constantly go from unshovelled sidewalks to perfectly fine sidewalks and back to icy again, these aren't the best option.
770, ....and in listening to the words of the title cut--in light of what's occurred on the East Coast, and what's going to occur if war goes on a lil too long--very, very, very prophetic. Looks as if our present is our past is our future. Marvin's vision captured it in this great album. At first I thought that I had nothing more to say of &quot;What's Going On&quot; other than what was already said below, but I find in listening to the CD now, it takes a poignant new meaning. Ain't that what great work is supposed to do?
771, Mrs. Meyer's geranium-scented products immediately put me in a good mood.  I love washing my hands with the geranium hand soap, cleaning around the kitchen or mopping the floor with the geranium-scented all-purpose cleanser, and doing dishes (or other cleaning) with the geranium-scented dish soap.  Other than a seasonal peppermint they had a few years back, I haven't found any other scents that I like quite as much.  The geranium scent is a little strong and not particularly manly, so I doubt it would have across-the-board appeal.  But I find it extremely clean, fresh, and unusual, a pleasant mix of floral and clean.  Although it costs a little more than I used to spend on hand soap, it really does make me smile every time I use it.  And that's worth a lot.
772, The book has a clever and interesting story. The problem I have is that when I read a novel I want to immerse myself in the story maybe even soak in it. In the Clancy novel there are several separate, but connected through the &#34;hero&#34;,  stories that are somewhat overlapping. The author shuffles back and forth in and out of the various story lines gradually bringing them all together at the end. I accept that some may well enjoy this up and down roller coaster technique but for me the warm inside soaking experience I&#8217;m wanting, is constantly being ripped apart. Thus for me 2 stars.
773, The songs on this cd are great. What made me buy it was my mom. My mom had a collage of music on tape. The song Tune in Tomorrow was on that tape. Let's say I owed mom the record because I warped the tape. Teena Marie shows soul music comes from the soul. What an excellent jazz song Wow. &quot;I need your lovin&quot; already a dance classic. The bass line hooks you in from the beginning. also get&quot;It must be Magic&quot; that cd will definitely get you started as a fan.
774, (Still lolling @ Macaroni's review. Tres amusing, because a lot of it is true.)While i feel that there was some progress in the story, it did kind of crawl by. It seems all the interesting stuff gets skipped over and we pick up chapters wondering who its about and what happened and why we never get to read it except through some anticlimactic flashback.I blazed through the first 3 books but these last 2 were a bit of a struggle.  (Its getting a little overdone when every time someones bites the dust I'm not convinced they're actually dead. By design? Don't know but I'm ready for some new tricks.)I think DoD ended in an interesting place though. Looking forward to #6 and hoping for some satisfying engaging storylines versus after-the-fact character narratives.
775, I bought these after my son yanked open a drawer on a 5 drawer dresser and it tipped and fell on him. I was standing right there and was able to catch it and break the fall. If it had fallen on him I doubt he could have survived. We strapped everything in the house to the walls and found these straps to be easy to use. Its an added peace of mind having these in case I am ever not there to catch a falling dresser. Buy them, use them, prevent serious injury.
776, I currently own the New Trent iTorch IMP52D.  I love this product.  I enjoying being outdoors and backing/hiking.  This product has allowed me to take those trips and have a peace of mind about my iPhone's battery.  I use my phone to make calls, text, and use GPS while on the trails.  I needed a way to charge my iPhone without carrying a huge battery pack or something really heavy.  This product has performed flawlessly in my travels.  I can at least get 2 to 3 full charges out of this battery pack.  The laser and light also come in handy when something may arise.  I am looking to buy a different model as well to expand the charging capacity.  Everything from the size of the iTorch to the functionality has been well received.  The only complaint that I may have is that it takes too long to charge.
777, This product is great if you want to start corset training.  It's very comfortable compared to other shapers I have tried after my c-sections.  Does not irritate the skin like some other products, easy to forget your wearing it as you go though your normal day.  Do not buy this item one size too small thinking a smaller size will work better.  Buy in your size and it's great!  Offers a bit of back support also.  With those tender stomach muscles cut, it puts extra pressure on the back to compensate, the garment helps with that problem a little.
778, I previously purchased this identical shoe in a different color (brown).  I was a very durable and well fiting shoe.  Although they are supposed to be the exact same shoe, the black one fits a bit higher at the top of the back of the ankle and rubs a bit while wlaking. It is irritating to walk a long distance.  I've worn them several times and I am still waiting (hoping) for them to break in.  I think these shoes may be made by different suppliers, in different countries.
779, The concept is engaging--a scientist receives warnings from somewhere in space that catastrophic events are going to occur and a team of police and scientists set about attempting to divert these catastrophes from happening--with varying success.  The series would be more compelling if there were a gradual unravelling of the mystery behind the signals.  This is a single, plot-line show where a dual plot line--one that reveals an alternate reality beyond what is happening in real time--would have provided depth and thought-provoking meaning for audiences.  The female protagonist is excellent.  The brooding male scientist comes off a bit creepy instead of troubled as he is meant to be, I believe.  If you want something border-line sci-fi and still engaging, try Warehouse 13, Touched, or 666 Park Avenue.
780, This is a great show, but I do not get the BBC channel out here in the sticks where I live so my Amazon Prime membership is perfect for me to watch all the shows I love but never get to see on TV. Now with Amazon Prime I can watch through my PC in my bed room, my Wii on my Family Room TV, and my son has an internet ready TV that he can watch what he wants on. I love this show and I love love love my Amazon Prime membership.
781, Straight forward pricing, no gimmick like those with a 3 digit list price and then gives a discount trying to make you think their product is better.  Anyway, this cooler is well built and comes with everything you need to mount it anywhere, anyway reasonable you like which including more then shown on the picture such fittings, couplers, tube, screws, brackets and so on.  I was suckered in try another brand and I was so disappointed when I open the box, no, it is not even in a box.  The built quality is  a C, but can judge on its functionality, but it wouldn't be better then the B&M for sure.  Ended up mounting it with the left over parts from the B&Ms I installed on the other cars.
782, First, it's great that Under Armour has a fairly complete catalog on Amazon. It used to take a trip to the sporting goods store, but now I can buy online.These are the heavy, thick but breathable fleece sweats, finished to a nice, clean surface on the outside. They're warm, but not so warm that you couldn't wear them outside on an early summer day. They also hold up well from repeated washings...my last pair lasted a very long time, and I suspect these will, too.The fit is slightly on the large side. The elastic waist holds them in place, but there's plenty of room all around.Only small complaint is that they are a bit long for me. Last pair I bought was perfect in length, but these - supposedly the exact same style - are 1-2" too long for me. Still, overall I'm satisfied and would recommend these to anyone wanting top quality at a fair price.
783, Romans on the defensive from the Picts, trapped and trying to get back home. A lot of battle/fight scenes. Guts, blood, beheading, hacking, squirting blood, etc. Backstabbing, and not just with weapons. A fierce female warrior and a lovestory thrown in for good measure.Michael Fassbender is excellent. Liam Cunningham, not listed anywhere as being in this movie, is a main character and also goes a great job. Overall, the acting is pretty good.Between 3 and 4 stars. Good to watch if you have nothing else to do.
784, Neutrogena transparent facial bar soap is such a wonderful soap, and it lasts a looooong time. I use this with my Clarisonic and it works wonders! With other soaps my face would dry out, but this soap leaves the moisture in your skin. A little bit will go a long way with this soap since it lathers so well. I rub my Clarisonic on it a few times, and the lather is amazing! It is also great for removing makeup. I rinse my face with hot water, grab this bar, rub it between my hands a few times, then rub the lather on my face and massage it all around. I only have to do that once to get all of my make up off. With other soaps I have to lather and rinse nearly 5 times before all of my makeup will come off. Neutrogena is amazing, I would recommend this to anyone looking for a great facial bar soap or even just a soap to remove makeup. Oh! and it smells wonderful!
785, These are simple glass baby bottles.  They're not fancy, but they have no nasty chemicals. I know that the plastic bottles are now all BPA free, but who knows what chemical they'll discover next year that's been leeching out of our plastic and poisoning us all this time.These bottles are compatible with my medela pump and can take the same lids, which is convenient.  However, for a breast-fed baby, even these so-called slow flow nipples are way too fast, and caused my baby to choke.  I bought Dr. Brown's nipples, which work great.  I now have these in 4 oz and 8 oz sizes.
786, These are my favorite t-shirts, great for lounging or for work (construction).  The material is the perfect weight...not too heavy, not too thin so no matter what the weather is, I'm comfortable in them. If it's a hot day, it doesn't cling to my skin and if it's a chilly day it layers well under a sweatshirt without bulking. I like how the material feels and that the collar area fits nice around the neck without any sagging.  They also wash and hold up well.
787, I've been using K&N; oil filters in my Talon and Evo for the past decade, through many different track events. They're very high flowing filters with low pressure drop. K&N; has charts on their website that shows how well they flow in low oil pressure situations, where competitors do not as well. Add to that the easy socket on the end for removal, and you have the best oil filter out there, IMO!No you probably won't notice any differences using this filter over others. It's kind of like peace of mind, trusting and knowing it will perform in tough situations. Don't go cheap on the little things for your car, especially when Amazon offers it for 9 bucks, it's only a few more then the cheapest Bosch's out there.
788, I've got a pair of these wipers (19" and 24") for my E90 BMW, to replace the awful OEM wipers which started to produce the highly annoying squeaking sound and which dealer refused to replace for free because supposedly dealers can replace them for free only once a year or so (so much for BMW's "free" maintenance...). The installation was very easy, the fit was perfect (not sure why other people were complaining about improper fit) and the wipers have performed well, without any streaks or any unpleasant sounds, since the last October. Not sure how long they'll last and how they'll behave in REAL winter (which never happened this season in North East) but so far I am perfectly satisfied with them and will continue to use them in future (just have to memorize to remove them before giving the car to dealer for "scheduled maintenance" so the dealer wouldn't try to replace them with OEM junk).
789, A work of vast scope and moving detail (both this title and the series for which it is the first installment).  Nominally an adventure story about the colinization of Mars (bet you didn't see that coming) it is ultimetly about ideas and the people who must wrestle with them in the real world.  Touching on scientific, political, and philosophical issues and the points at which they intersect Stanley uses Mars as a backdrop to discuss the human condition and the nature of human society.  Stanley's prose brilliantly portrays the stark, claustrophobic enviroment that living on Mars would bring.  I can not find anything negative to say about this work except that at times it  may seem a little dry and rambling but it is so overflowing with new ideas and fresh perspeciteves that it well rewards that effert that it demands to complete.  A must read.
790, This bath tub is very functional & cost efficient..considering you can use this for a very long time (just DON'T use chemicals to clean it/ USE Organic Cleaners!) All you would need is a little pad to put under baby's butt or back..everything else it perfect! It is a little on the Big side...so if you have a small place, I would invest in something a little smaller...GO TO [...] they have this bath tub & another one that is a little smaller, so you can actually hide it under a cabinet & not keep it out in th open all the time because of how big it is :) Just nail it to the wall (back of door) like I did :)
791, When your playing this it  feels just like your in a real las vegas casino. With the buy ins for all the different tournament. Even the whole way the screen is set up makes it feel so real. This is the best one ive found so far only downside is it doesnt give u much to play with if you dont buy. So you have to bet extremely low and cant play awhile. Still its fun and i recommend anyone looking for a real blackjack app to dowload this one.
792, This thing is amazing. I had camped a lot with my parents when I was younger, but that consisted of a pop-up camper and utilizing an empty coffee can when you had to take a leak in the middle of the night. I purchased my first camper in May of 2012 and it was a fifth wheel with an indoor bathroom. Well trying to buy all the little doohickeys that you need is unreal and boy does it add up fast, but I would highly recommend this doohickey to anyone. The first time I used it I knew that I had gotten my monies worth. This thing is great and the way it allows you to wash your hose out when you are done is just priceless. Yes you will never get all of the pooh out of all of the crevices, but let me tell you this gets I would guess 99% of it out. What else is there to say except buy this.
793, I keep coming back to this mascara. Not due to superior coverage or lengthening, but due to the fact that is never clumps. I have other mascaras that I like for a while, until it starts clumping. This mascara never seems to clump, even after you have had it a couple of months. I will say that with the waterproof, you need to let it dry between coats. I have tried many brands and types. This wand works very well for both top and bottom lashes and there is a reason it has been around for so long. It is cost effective and just performs well.
794, Bought these because the 2x2's I was using were old and splitting.  They work as anyone would expect a plastic pad to put on the ground to stabalize a trailer to do. They're not very tall...because they're flat...so depending on how high your trailer is after you level it with the Camco 44412 RV Wheel Chock you bought (because you need to be level before your stabilized) you may need to put a tree stump or something underneath of this, or buy more of these and stack them.  They seem to interlock rather well.
795, This is possibly the best asomble of songs put together to make an album. This was a ground breaking album for its time, it was the first double disc album ever made, it had the so many popular videos released of it and it was made in under 3 weeks.In most albums there are stand out songs but this is one of the few rap albums ever made that just has awesome song after song but if i had to pick my favourite song of the album at the moment it would probably be wonder why they call u bitch, ambitionz as a riddah or 2 of amerikaz most wanted. I highly reccomend you buy this album n if ur one of those people that is strongly against pac cause of his beef wit biggie, i feel sorry 4 u that u cant appreciate both of their music n u need 2 get ova it n buy this album, n 2 all the people that hate on pac EAT A D*CK UP
796, I downloaded this onto my Kindle Fire and love it! I love how when I am done each night it says how much I will weigh in 5 weeks. I have the ability to make meals or get my recipes on here. I can even use it on my windows phone! I would truly LOVE LOVE LOVE it if it would budget my calories throughout the day. Like if I could write my bedtime and wake up time so it could tell me I should eat so many calories for breakfast than so many for lunch and so many for supper with so many leftovers for snacks! That would be seriously awesome! Either way, I use another app on my phone with this. It is awesome and helpful. So far between the apps I have lost 12 pounds and I am still going! The barcode scanner is great! I have only had to enter 1 food so far! I love being able to look at my friends diaries and to motivate them and likewise with mine. Wonderful app.
797, What am I saying?Yes, On the Turning Away done live on this album is without question the summit of great lead guitar work. Gilmour bleeds his Strat and blends it with power chords that weaken the knees. Best lead guitar song ever recorded. Stack it against any, and I mean any, guitar solo. There seems to be a "how fast can he play?" or "how complicated can he get?" mentality in music in the past decades. On the Turning Away is hard evidence that quality and craftmanship cannot be rushed. Gilmour was voted Number 1 Guitarist of All Time in a UK Billboard poll a couple of years ago. Here is the proof. It is PURE MAGIC.
798, The case looked great and snapped on tight.  But the minute I snapped it on, I realized, that I needed to remove the microSD card from the phone, copy some files on it and put it back.  It is nearly impossible to remove the card from Centro without removing the battery cover first (what clever engineer at Palm thought THAT would be a good idea?!?!? definitely not a usability expert).  So... hmmm.... yeah... eventually couple of days later a fearless friend of mine pried it open with his extremely sharp almost surgical quality blade.  He did not break it, but said that the case will not survive if I had to open it on a regular basis.  So - its a great case if you never need to open the battery cover.  If you do need to open it - look for a different case.
799, This is a universal sensor and you need to connect the connector.  It is pretty tricky to do the connection.  I used the clamping method as suggested but found that the connection is not tight as I just used a regular wiring clamping tool.I tried to solder but it failed as the material of the wire did not accept soldering.  Finally, I used a crossed twisted method to join the wire itself and then wrap it by thin copper wires and then solder the wrap.  The joint is very tight and I cannot pull it apart.  Replace it in the vehicle, it works fine and no more check engine light.
800, This is magnificent!  I am 56 with very fair skin and somewhere along the way lost my &#34;pretty&#34;. I reevaluate my skin care and makeup every year at my birthday and recently decided to try the Regenerist products. I use the Deep Hydration as day cream.This morning, I cleansed, used the skin tightening serum, and moisturized with this product.  I was sidetracked before I could start my makeup, and when I returned to my dressing table, immediately started choosing a lipstick. It wasn't until I had applied the lipstick that I realized I had no foundation or blush on!  What!!!???My complexion has improved drastically.  No more redness on my nose and chin.  I don't need to use a primer before foundation.  I barely use concealer anymore.I love the pre-measured dispenser top, and that this does not have an SPF (I find them irritating) or fragrance.
801, I love the new plantronics voyager 855. It pairs great with my Nokia N82. My only gripes are that the call/talk button can be difficult to press and the audio quality is good but not great. For audiophiles, the 855 wont cut it. But I think I can safely say that no BT headset has great audio. If fidelity is what you want, you favorite headphones are better suited for the job, but if you want to walk around town, make calls, and listen to tunes this headset is awesome. It has great audio isolation and decent sound quality.
802, I am very pleased with the purchase of these overalls. I have a small farm (very small, just 4 acres) but needed some tough yet comfortable practical clothing. We have sheep and do a lot of organic farming - plus I am always fixing some portion of the fence, pens or some other chore.These overalls look great and perform. The stone-washed denim looks great and feels even better. There are pockets everywhere and for most any use. And the straps are easy to adjust.I'd recommend these overalls to ANYONE who likes comfortable and also convenient clothing. They will only get better with use and washings. LOVE these overalls.
803, Life with the iTorch 5200 is VERY easy for someone on the go. Ive had it for at least a year. The charger is pocket size. It keeps at least 3 full charges for my iphone 4 or 5 (I upgraded), but thats not all... it also charges my iPad mini air and my Jaybird headphones! THATS RIGHT!!... if you have a USB connection, you are going to get your device charged. Even better is that it doesnt weigh anything. If its in my work bag, backpack on a hike, or in my kid's diaper bag... I dont have to worry about if my stuff has been charged. WAIT theres more! Charging the iTorch 5200 only takes 30-40 min. I havent timed it but considering it taked my iphone and ipad at least an hour to to charge, time well spent! What are you waiting for... buy it. Heck, I'm sold on buying another writing this =p
804, Annie Lennix: On word---HOT! Her velvet voice sears in this DVD with The Eurythmics videos. Includes "Sweet Dreams", "Who's That Girl?", "Love is a Stranger", "Here Comes the Rain Again", "Right By Your Side", "It's Alright, Baby's Coming Back", "Sexcrime 1984", "Missionary Man", "Would I Lie To You?", "There Must Be an Angel" & many other great, great hits.VERY recommended!
805, Great for working in the yard or exercise.  These guys are compact & lightweight.  Comfort is good, though it decreases slightly on  extended use.  The earphones stay centered on your ears.  Phone call quality is excellent for both parties.  The controls are easy to use & well designed.The only negative was that the bass response was not as strong as I had hoped for, but they sound good & work great.  For the price, they can't be beat & they are quite handy on a cold windy day.
806, FIT TOO SMALL FOR ME, I'M A SIZE 34 WAIST. I GOT THE LARGE AND IT WAS 36-39. NOT GOOD. I RE-ORDERED AND GOT THE MED. 32-34. AND IT WAS WRONG AGAIN, IT WAS A 31 WAIST, SO IF YOUR A SMALL GUY WAIST 29, GET THE MED. IF YOU'RE A REG GUY GET THE LARGE AND HOPE IT SHRINKS IN THE WASH. THE PANTS ARE EXCELLENT, I KEPT THE LARGE AND WILL WASH TILL IT SHRINKS, THEY SHOULD BE PERFECT THEN, THANKS.
807, We opened this because the storyline sounded provocative - a mystery at Oxford.  It was not very intriguing starting out, but...willing to wait (sometimes a story has to &#34;warm up.&#34;)  This one became purient-plus (I realize that there is not such word, but how else to emphasize the content of this movie), and must admit we cannot give a full review - we turned it off.  Guess we were naive, for such an open sexual exhibition was not something we would have expected (unless the movie were rated R or xxx - which this one was not.)  We would say that it was right up the alley for a voyeur.  Suggestive is one thing, but this was eversomuch more.Therefore, can say if you enjoy visual sex, this is the movie for you. If not, would advise you to look elsewhere.
808, This is my first time experimenting with jojoba oil and I really love it. This oil moisturizes my skin and scalp without feeling heavy or greasy. It absorbs really quickly and I'm comforted to know that it is USDA organic. My skin also remains moisturized all day after putting this product on in the morning. I am very sensitive to product odors and this oil carries a very very slight smell. However, it is not offensive at all and disappears after applying the product. I would definitely purchase this product again and recommend it to others.
809, There was a funny "Hard Day's Night," a goofy-funny "Help"...and "Magical Mystery Tour," apparently filmed intentionally out of focus or the folks at Avenue One were fooling with me.  Filmed with all the aplumb of a high school video production shot in Super 8, if you remember what that was.  The unapparent plot involves a bus and an ongoing spat- apparently comedy relief- between Richard B. Starkey and his aunt Jessica.  The music, however, is better than ever.  A must purchase for Beatles completists, but others may merely content themselves to purchasing the "Magical Mystery Tour" CD available from Amazon.  Oh well, the DVD from Amazon Marketplace cost less than a movie ticket in the big city.
810, This albums concluding track is the definitive Stevie Wondersong of the 80's in the minds of many-&quot;Happy Birthday&quot; being thesynth-funk tribute to Martin Luther King Jr. that played a giantpart in making the human rights hero's birthday a national holiday.Horray for Wonder AND horray for delivering yet anotherdiverse and ear-catching album.From Stevie's sweaty,cornrowedhair on the cover and burning piano on the back &quot;Hotter Then July&quot; revels in Stevie's wonderous 70's eclecticism from therocking lead-off &quot;Did You Have To Say You Love Me&quot;,the smooth andcatchy dance-R&amp;B of &quot;All I Do&quot; and the VERY sensual ballad&quot;Rocket Love&quot;-great start but that's not the HALF of it.From thecounrty pop of &quot;I Ain't Gonna Stand For It&quot;,the reggae-ish BobMarley tribute hit &quot;Master Blaster&quot; and the typical deeply funkyclavinet-dominated pieces &quot;Do Like You&quot; and the topical &quot;Cash InYour Face&quot;.Do ALL slow declines sound this good?AGHHHHH!!!Wrong-Stevie Wonder NEVER declined-he just had a new beginning and hereit's a beginning well worth investigating!
811, After the battery is mostly charged, this charger goes to 16.4 volts and starts boiling the electrolyte. Normally when battery is mostly charged, the voltage should not go that high!!! The charger did not switch to a float mode either as it was supposed to.To make sure it is not a battery issue, I tried to use this charger on 3 different batteries and saw the same result. Charger at 16.4 volts and boiling electrolyte. If I was not keeping a close eye on the charger, it would have destroyed my battery by boiling out all electrolyte. I thought this thing is "smart" and "automatic."Did I also mention that one time I was tried to use the charger(see above for results) it was making a lot of loud noise because of a constantly running cooling fan.
812, It doesn't get any beter than this Stevie Wonder is considered a musical geinus and  he definitely deserves that title and he should wear it ...... He is so extraordinarily wonderful and this is one of his nest albums everys ong on here is good and every song has a great meaning to it this album is wonderful and it brings back a lot of memories!!!!!  My favorites are Sir Duke, I wish, As, Knocks Me off My Feet, and many more!!!!If you like neo-soul then I would definitely recommend that you buy this this album because this classic neo-soul at its finest!!!!This album also reminds me of the good old days!!!!
813, i must concur with my friend above . this is a supurb evening with john and friends . the sound and picture are really excellent . i recall seeing john and his working quartet (joe lovano,dennis irwin and bill stewart) circa "what we do" visit new smyrna beach . john's parents lived nearby and he and the fellas had just come down from new york city . the quartet songs performed here can be heard on several sco projects including "flat out" , "meant to be" and his first blue note record "time on my hands". the duets remind me of john's work with mccoy tyner on the project "things ain't what they used to be" (blue note) intimate , bluesy and lovely . to have also performed a couple songs with the remarkable marvin smith and don pullen make for a truly mind bending evening of creative collaberation . an absolute must have for jazz guitar fans and sco fans and deep musician lovers . what a discovery .
814, The fabric is the softest, and the thick lacy detailing is so sweet. This is my go-to black tank top. I wear it under nearly everything. The front does not sit as low on me as on the model, so it covers nicely. My last one was a hand-me-down which lasted several years, the new one I ordered to replace it is the same quality. I usually wear a medium/6 bottoms and large/8 on top, but in this I order/wear a MEDIUM.
815, I purchased this after reading positive reviews on reputable product review site Cosmetic Cop.Pros: Effective ingredients (niacinamide & peptide are the star ingredients of anti-aging), affordable price tag, fragrance free, decent packaging.Cons: Sits on top of my skin, feels very silicone-y and sure enough it broke me out a fair amount.I'm typically ill tolerated by products with higher composition of silicone, other silicone-heavy products that broke me out are Smashbox primer & most Giorgio Armani foundations. This serum congested my skin congested & broke out at areas where I usually don't. I looked back at the reviewers who gave low rating to this serum & unsurprisingly, a good portion of them said that it broke them out as well.My skin was normal again after switching back to (my favorite) Caudalie Vinosource SOS serum.I'd love an affordable & high performance serum, too bad this isn't it.
816, If you are diligent and take the time to record your exercise, what you eat, and drink and your goals, this app will help you track your fitness very handily. I like that it has a bar code scanner on the version that I use on my iPod Touch and stores all the foods and exercises that you enter so that if you duplicate that meal or exercise you don't have to start from scratch to enter it. It even has an option of connecting with a friend, or getting to know others using the app for added fitness accountability.
817, Inspector Foyle behaves and speaks exactly as we would ideally wish to have done in his place in the threatening environment of wartime where subtlety and nuance tended to get lost. In WWII Hastings, a resort town on the south coast of England, the proximity of the German forces across the Channel pushed people to make hasty decisions, often based on prejudice and invariably without pausing to reflect. Foyle is the epitome of patience, bravely resisting pressure from his superiors and the war department, creating time and space to see justice done no matter how complex the circumstances, He is assisted by two younger assistants who share his humanity and learn from his stoical attitude. It is hard not to feel that people like Foyle were the true heroes of the war effort because they constantly reminded everyone of the values we were fighting for.
818, Got this for my hubby who is a total music fan.  He is enjoying this project for it has all the favorites we've come to know and love.  There's nothing like their sound (horns, drums,etc).  Their music is happy and puts you in "feel good groovin' mood".We both are enjoying listening to it. Received it during the timeframe indicated with no damage done to it during transport.  Enjoyed purchasing with Amazon for it is truly hassle free.  Will continue to do business with Amazon in the future.Thanks
819, There isn't anything bad to say about this series. I want it to go on and on. In fact, I dreaded watching the last episode of season 2 because I knew that was it. I know there is a third season, but it is not available - so far.  True entertainment. I fell in love with all of the characters - even felt sorry for Henry Dean - whom I despised all through the series. But, then in a twist of a writer's pen, I felt sorry for him. The writing in so well done that you want to know more about each of the characters. And, it is especially troubling to know that these stories are based on real life events. Come on Amazon - bring us Season 3!!
820, After looking at the local cheapo stores like Whale-mart, Tar-gut, Infamous feetwear, etc, I wasn't sure I could get a quality pair of casual slip ons, everything the mentioned junk shops plus a few others sold were absolute garbage. I thought it would be risky buying shoes on-line, but what kind of fool am I?Amazon just plain rocks, and these Sperry top siders are just plain first class, top quality shoes. These are also made in China, but the quality is surprisingly good. Fit is good, support insoles, and these look good, too. I believe I have become a Sperry customer......
821, I'm a huge cell phone fan and I tend to try out the latest and greatest.  So far, this phone is it.  I won't rehash all the features because you can read about those elsewhere.  The highlights for me were the excellent battery life and the fact that it has just about every feature you could want in a PDA phone.  The size isn't even that bad.  I had resisted getting a PDA phone because of the size, but I've found I can still get this into my pocket.  I'm glad I didn't give in to getting an iPhone because this has it beat.  The only thing I found annoying is that there is no mini-plug jack.  You can buy an inexpensive converter to plug in headphones, but it's weird they didn't include that.  Otherwise, I love it.  Makes me glad I have AT&T.
822, I'm a big fan of Tom Clancy's thrillers. Unfortunately, most of what makes them enjoyable to me is sadly lacking in this novel - the intricate global conflicts between various countries and political groups, the gobs of military technology, the inner workings and interactions of various government agencies.What we are given here instead is a tale of one man fighting his own private war on drugs. An interesting idea, but unlike Mr. Clancy's usual subject matter he demonstrates little knowledge of the domestic U.S. drug trade. The Drugs Are Bad message is hammered home in an unnecessarily preachy manner, and I found myself wishing that Clancy had been more succinct. Nancy Reagan managed to sum up the point of this novel in three words, and I'll echo them as my advice to potential readers: Just Say No.
823, What is totally cool about this app is that it gives me the ability to track my sugar and sodium intake. This is important to me because I can see where the bulk of my sugars are coming from and adjust my meals accordingly.  It is official I am hooked on this app.  I also like the fact that it syncs your information online so you have the ability to not only track your progress on your phone (I'm using my Kindle Fire) you have this information available to you online.  Plus there is a plethora of information available to you online to help you be successful in your weight loss goals.  I like the online blog that is provided for you with your account.  Oh and let me mention that it is free....Your own little Diet and Fitness Coach in an app...This is perfect for me...
824, My basic cable service didn't carry TVLAND so I had never watched this show until I bought my Kindle Fire HD and Prime subscription. I'm catching up with this show and it has been fun.Season 1 will tell you how these 3 L.A. women ended up living in Cleveland with a feisty 90 year old in Cleveland. It has been a lot of fun and chuckles watching this show. It is heart-warming to see some of the surprise guests who make an appearance or are reoccurring guests. Comedian men of a certain age get to show up regularly as dates of Betty White: Don Rickles, Tim Conway, Carl Reiner to name a few. Handsome heartthrobs like John Schneider show up as potential boyfriends for the other actresses.The sets for the different rooms in their house have great visual appeal.Each show is a solidly good production with a lot of fun entertainment.Watching this show for free is paying for my Amazon Prime Membership.
825, If you've ever tried weight watchers online tools and found them lacking (and pricey!) , give this free app a try.  You get a reasonable calorie goal, a huge database of nutrition information, and an easy to use program.  You can track water, food, exercise, measurements, as well as user chosen data such as blood pressure or sugar.  You can also change the goals given in the program to match what your doctor asked you to follow (low sodium or carb, for example).  You can use the program from your computer or apps on your devices and they sync up nicely.  Give it a try if you have reason to track your food.
826, My dermatologist recommended this soap to me, for my acne.  I have had acne vulgaris and cystic acne for more than 20 years.  I have tried every acne product out there, including ProActiv, and nothing works as good as this soap (especially in conjunction with my acne prescriptions!) I use the PanOxl soap every day, as my dermatologist recommended.  My daughter also uses this soap (and nothing else) to treat her teenage acne.  It clears her up within a day or two - every time!The bar comes in a plastic tray with a lid, so you can keep it dry in the shower. One bar lasts me several months, with daily use. Some people will experience dry skin, and even redness and itching with this product.  This will go away after some use, or you can skip a day here and there.
827, Prior to knowing better, I subjected my poor baby to conventional baby toothpastes.  She hated them and she'd gag when I brushed her teeth.  Not only that, I can't believe some of the ingredients that the popular companies use in their toothpastes.  I actually hadn't heard of this brand until I was researching safe products on the EWG Skin Deep website.  This toothpaste was rated as the safest of children's toothpastes.Not only am I very happy with the ingredients and tooth-cleaning ability of this product, I'm also happy that my toddler LOVES this stuff.  Seriously - I almost dread brushing her teeth at night because she throws a tantrum every time we're finished.  She loves brushing her teeth more than those Cyndi Lauper sound-alike Sesame Street Muppets did back in the '80s.
828, I originally bought a Leachco Safer Bather Infant Bath Pad based on all the good reviews.  I did not have any luck with it, was very hard to bathe baby alone so I searched again and came across this one.  It is exactly what I needed.  I am able to bathe my little one without any help.  She was probably about 8 lbs when we started using this tub and it cradles her so nicely so I don't have to hold her up or worry about her slipping under the water.  She is able to kick her feet and feels cradled and secure up by her arms.  This is really an awesome design.  It is a really big tub though.  We store it in her bedroom after it dries because there is no room in our bathroom for it.  That is the only downside, but it doesn't take away from the product at all so I didn't lower the rating.  Would highly recommend this tub.
829, I normally use MyFitnessPal but thought I would give this a try. It sounded like it had more features that could be useful.I was correct about the features but the interface it TERRIBLE. The homescreen is extremely confusing and advertises a lot of other apps for you to download. You would think that since these are all part of the same set (the widget and Calorific) that they would integrate into the program, but that's not the case. If you click on the different programs it always asks if you want to download the same program you already own...Besides that, it's just very difficult to use. It takes almost an hour to set everything up if you download all of the add-ons. MyFitnessPal is just easier to use. The only thing I really like about this program is that when you finally figure out how to begin an exercise it has an integrated music app.
830, How could Martin's editors have let this go into print?  Was he to be paid no matter what drivel he put out.  Warning to anyone who hasn't read this yet - Go back and read the end of Feast and consider that the 'cliff hanger' end of Martin's career.  Martin put absolutely no thought into this story line (if you can even call it that).  There simply is no story.  I expected more from a person with such a loyal fan base.  It just goes to show you that some people simply don't care about their customers - so our only recourse is to give up on his future writings.  We have all been had...
831, This soviet film suffers from erratic quality color photography and filming and a sound quality that is often of a 1940's Western Electric style.  The orchestra is extremely sloppy and the music is not very well played.  Fortunately, the poor sound quality masks some of the worst orchestra moments.  That is the bad news.  The good news is that the scenery is appropriate to 12th century Rus and the steppes.  The log structures and the plains scenery fits the story.  Much of the costuming and action is very exciting and makes it clear why Borodin's music has been used to add atmosphere to US Westerns.  With the exception of the Khan's daughter, all the singing seems really excellent within the limitations of the sound track.  Poor quality dubbing is also a problem.  Still, I can recommend this just because it is the only version of Prince Igor available on film.  It has enough strong points to make it worth buying.
832, How do you rate an oil filter? I'll just say I've been using Mobil 1 for 20+ years and I've never had any lubrication related engine damage casualties. I drive hard long miles too. The filter, seems to be built particularly to stand up to M1's longevity and thickness. I never knew they made filters until I joined Amazon. Always used stock. Now I don't understand why Amazon's pricing on the oil is so bad. 5qt bottles here are $50+ as compared to $25 at Walmart(one of the best deals known to man). Enough said...
833, This could be a5-star app except for three issues. First, there's no insurance option for ace up in the dealer's hand. Not that I use it that frequently, but I've never encountered a blackjack program without it.Second, the HUGE ads that pop up too frequently are a great annoyance.Third,  I just discovered that the app will occasionally hit on 17. I believe this is a big no-no.I'm tempted to knock off two stars for this combination of issues, but I will satisfy myself with one for the moment.
834, no plastic-leaching worries from these bottles due to potential dangers of #7 plastic bottles that most plastic baby bottles are made of. i was also surprised at how affordable they were. the item was shipped quickly. my only slight complaint is that i wish these came with silicone nipples instead.also, my opinion is that there's no need to buy a 4oz bottle since babies will quickly grow out of that stage. if you're short on money, just get the 8oz ones - you'll be holding the bottle when feeding a baby who can  only consume smaller amount of milk, so no need to worry about the larger size for the baby.
835, I found this novel to be interesting as it takes the reader into the world of silk making and the dressmaker and her granddaughter Lenore who marries into the prestigious and wealthy family of the Sallonger, who owns the silk. There one will find the secrets of violent and mysterious acts and the shadow that plagues of deceit that touches everyone involved in this world. The drawback of the novel is that there are many repeated paragraphs that tries to make inference to the importance of the scenes, but if you can bypass this little annoyance than you will be caught up into the world of the Silk Vendetta.  augie
836, I did not purchase this for the listed application. I wanted an oversize holster to fit my Samsung Galaxy S III with an extended battery or protective case. The phone slides in and out of the case easily for either application. The pouch itself is a bit bulky for my taste and could stand to be about 1/2 inch narrower. The belt clip will not turn to provide additonal comfort which would be my preference.Overall, it works for what I bought it for. It is a good solution, but not a perfect one. The pouch appears to be of good construction and will likely last me for several years of use.
837, Although it was short lived on the series lineups, it had a good cast and script of action, suspense, and science-fiction to keep all those who attempt to make science work in science fiction, busy watching. Aliens and populated Earth bound ascentient beings existing over time has many philosophical brain teasers questioning whether we are alone or if your neighbor, loved-one, or friend are bit more than you think.  It's a great re-watch of Science Fiction made into a series that does not or should not bend your mind too much. Enjoy.
838, In honor of the Mars Rover Landing I decided to read this book.  I think seeing the rover pictures really helped me understand the landscapes and visualize the descriptions from the author.In one word this book was "Epic".  Long, complex and full of details.  The first part of the book captured my attention. I loved hearing about the colonization of Mars and the first 100.  I got a bit lost in the middle of the book when it focused on political intrigue and the varying options of how Mars should be settled and what the future should look like.  It lost the wonder of the first section.  However, the conclusion was fantastic.  The planet wide war was fascinating and the final conclusion kept me on the edge of my seat.  I want to see the ice dome of the hidden colony.
839, It comes in two halves with a top. You attach everything and then slide it over top of your tanks. For me, I was expecting something a little better built. Especially since I was looking for something that would deter others from messing with my tanks. This does not do that. It simply keeps debris from hitting the tanks when you are in motion. It also does not fasten down very well to the trailer, so if somebody wanted to take it too, then there is no problem for them. At the very least, it looks better than just two tanks sitting on the front.
840, Fits perfect in a pocket, backpack, purse, etc. My wife loves having a sleek and stylish battery to keep her iphone charged all day. It's nice to be on vacation, or a "staycation" at Disneyland and not have to make the whole trip come to a screeching halt having to charge mobile devices. With the iTorch we were able to keep moving without having to be tethered to an electrical outlet and waiting for phones to charge. The flashlight and laser pointer come in handy as well. Got a lot of jealous looks from other tourists wishing they had one to charge their phones.
841, This app is one of the better webs offered on amazon.  The problem is that I also have friendcaster for facebook.  I do not need two apps for both.  I prefer using facebook to twitter anyway.  Friendcaster for facsnook is the better app.  Ed. I do not see the benefit of having seperate lists for twitter users.  I do not follow a huge number of subjects, so using this feature does not make sense.  Still, it is a good app if you like twitter.
842, Confession: I am a long-time devotee to Burts Beeswax Lip Balm (also available on Amazon). When my lips are really dry, though, I reach for this. It sticks around if I put it on at bedtime, so my lips don't crack. I've never had a cold sore, but I sometimes will cut the corners of my mouth shaving; this keeps them from cracking, shortening healing time.There is no flavor to speak of, and no tingle. It's not as greasy as vaseline, not as waxy as most lip balms, and lasts for longer than any other I've found.
843, Robinson attempts a grand and bold vision in his book Red Mars. He melds hard science with the politics and conniving, brinkmanship, and differing visions of the settlers. The description of the myriad ways in which the settlers attempt to terraform Mars is very interesting, but Robinson doesn't quite pull off the human elements--the various and contradictory motives of the various and growing groups on Mars and their plans and plots. A lot of this part of the book devolves into speech-making by the characters in the story, and it makes the book rather boring, especially in the middle of the book. Robinson can't quite pull of what Frank Herbert and Ursula K. LeGuin did so masterfully in Dune and The Left Hand of Darkness, respectfully; that is, to immerse the reader not only in a future scenario, but a political human scenario, played out against a science fiction backdrop.Still, this is a fairly good read, and I recommend it if only for the vision of what terraforming Mars might look like.
844, I bought 3 of these sweatshirts and love them all. They are a great quality and warm and soft and cozy.  They have a reasonable price and fit nicely.  I am a female and I bought a small and they fit comfortable. I normally wear a medium in sweaters and shirts but thought since this is more of a man's sweatshirt  I would try the small.  I must admit if I was a store, I would of tried the medium just to check.  But I am pleased with this purchase.  Shipped quickly.
845, I looked for one of these apps for a long time, and then I was fortunate to get a personal trainer for a short while and she recomended this one. Once your signed in you can add your own food choices, or pick from their lists, they have food listed from all kinds of stores and restuarants. The app keeps track of your goals, your exercise (the more you do the more calories you can have) and it also snyc's with your smart phone, pad and computer. Just watching what I eat helped me to lose weight.
846, I purchase this vinyl to add to my collection.  I loved this project when it dropped in the mid-90s but I've lost the CD since then.  The only complaint I have is how the records do not fit well in the jacket.  It's a 4 album set/double jacket with 2 albums fitting in each jacket.  It seems to me the manufacturer should have increased the width of the sleeves. It was hard to get them out and darn near impossible to get them back in,  But the albums play great!
847, I purchased one, but will be purchasing more as my husband really likes these.  Helike the multi use pocket as well as the depth in all the pockets and how they fit (not too snug and not too loose.He especially likes the buttons on the back left pocket.  It is very useful for buttoning in his wallet or other things ofthat nature.  He feels more secure with that button.  Recently, I purchased the same brandfrom a store and didn't notice that it had no button or buttonholes on the back left pockets.  Sonow I am trying to find a seamstress to put in buttonholes on those back pockets.  He prefers that theleft pocket has the button and usually it does.  I already washed the pants so I can't take them back to the store.My husband wears these for work as well as casual and occasionally to church if he doesn't need a dress shirt and tie.
848, I purchased a few of these in several colors to keep my warm at work. I am usually cold, but not anymore. The colors are sharp, they are a good fit (I'm a 38 short and got the large) and I actually like them so much I got the same colors in the short sleeve style for the summer. I also feel it's a good price, since the short sleeve shirts cost the same.As for the fit - I purchased a medium and a large. I usually wear a medium, but both shrank so much I decided to go with the large. The large shrank down to a loose medium, but the medium was a little too tight for me. I have put on some weight since my last purchased, so I think I am a large now. But I wanted everyone to know that they do shrink - big time. Plus, with the heavier material it's hard to get them over the shoulder as the material doesn't flex as much.
849, So you feel like the story has failed to advance?  Well I may be young and ignorant of the ways of reviews but what do you want?  Winter is coming and there is a lot of story going on!  Turns out that King's landing and the Iron Throne isn't the center of the universe after all.We started book 1 believing this was the story of the Starks and the north, nearly entirely a feint.  We moved along believing this is the story of Westero's only to find the rest of the world is far more interesting.  It turns out old Nan's stories are true and there are a lifetimes of novels ready to be written about them.  I'd love to see what there is even further east!The best part about a book is that it doesn't have to be all tied up by act 3 to neatly end on time in 2 hours.
850, There are a handful of artists who are true geniuses and transcend the ordinary performer.  Teena Marie is one of those whose talent far outclasses most of her time and beyond.  When this &quot;sister&quot; first  exploded on the scene two decades ago, she was welcomed as a pioneer, an  innovator, a revolutionary, and just one good singer.  Time has not  lessened her place in musical history.  &quot;Irons in the Fire,&quot; with  its opening track &quot;I Need Your Lovin'&quot; still packs a soulful  punch!  The girl, who plays various instruments, does her own backgrounds,  writes her own words and music, also possesses one powerful vocal  instrument. She ranks up there with Aretha and Patti as one who can send  chills up one's spine!
851, Nice looking shoe. I bought this shoe hoping it's work.  What matters most for me is how WIDE, how stable, how much heel support & price. These 10XW turned out to be too long & narrower than what I wanted. The bottom of the soles are also VERY slick.  Avoiding falling, while wearing them, would be tricky. I spend HOURS looking @ Ros Hommerson, Clark, Trotters,SoftStyle (among other brands.) From the 1 pair of Soft Style I tried on, I'd say they'll soon feel like shoes that will be hard on one's feet & will fall apart in no time. Since the bottom of the sole is SO slick, avoiding falling is also problematic.  I'm returning the pair I bought for a refund.  I found other brands in similar prices that are much better made shoes.
852, THIS WORKS! Years of Horrible Peeling Fingernails Healed. I had tried just about everything over the years, but this actually worked. Followed the directions with clean nails (swab with alcohol to clean well), added one coat per day for 4-5 days, removed and repeated. After about six weeks nails had grown out most of the weak or damaged nails; then used two coats once a week with color polish. I have a vertical split on my right thumb that is slowly improving, but all the other nails are in good shape. Must moisturize 2-3 times a day to keep nails & cuticles healthy. I just use almond oil with lavender oil added.
853, These lights will be the main lighting in my Teardrop Camper Trailer when I get back to work on it next spring. They look like good quality lights and the switch works perfectly on them. I connected one of them to 12v and they are nice and bright. The diffusers are great and do a good job of diffusing the light with no lines or shadows. These lights are very light weight, but that is not a concern as I am building my Teardrop as light as possible.If you are after LED lighting, these are also a good choice because you can easily upgrade the bulb to an LED Retrofit from most any Automotive supply store, Amazon, or Ebay. They have the direct replacement LEDs for RVs for most any fixture.You won't go wrong with these lights.
854, Like many Sci-Fi novels, Red Mars has two stories to tell - a story of science (the terraforming and colonization of Mars), and a story of people (the adventures of the Mars colonists).  The first story is fascinating and  thought-provoking, the second is uninteresting.  Put them together and you  have a really good book that could have been great.  If, like me, you're  interested in seeing what the future might be like, you'll enjoy the book,  but if what you're looking for is an interesting story, look elsewhere.
855, I have tried keeping a diet journal before and never really got going. MyFitnessPal is really good. It has a bar scan feature to input the nutrition label. It is so simple. The search option is very complete too. Other apps/web sites that I have tried just did not have the scope that this one does. AND best of all is the feedback that this app gives me. Once I complete my food diary for a day, I click on 'Complete this Entry' and I get an estimate of what I will weigh in 5 weeks. So when I am good, it gives me a virtual pat on the back and when I am bad, it lets me know how bad!
856, I say this because the cap I'm replacing with this one I bought from my buddy at the dealer only six months ago.....the code I got for my check engine light pointed to multiple items related to the emissions system that I already replaced. I read sometimes even new parts can fail out of the box, so I figure I would start with the cheapest. The gas cap! Installed this on my 02 suburban 5.3 1500 and what do you know, so far so good and it's been a few weeks!! Normally after I clear the check engine light it comes back on within days....I guess were good for now!! Great lookin cap, easy to install (again) and comes in original AC DELCO packaging.
857, The only reason that I did not enjoy this long read was: it's focus on the hardcore Sci-Fi reader. I'm not saying it's a bad book, just not for me. The author crams so much geology,theology, psychiatry,topography and much more in the book that it all becomes overwhelming.  He seems to remind us throughout the entire read(which I couldn't wait to end)about the same terrain over and over, the color of the sky and the types of volcanoes,mountains,craters,cracks and more craters with the same explanation. To hardcore for me. A true fan of any book about the colonization of Mars, you will love it. I couldn't wait to leave the planet.For better books based on Mars, I would suggest Robert Heinlein's "Red Planet"(see my review) or Ray Bradbury's "The Martian Chronicles".
858, I'm not sure how long this worked for...my girlfriend noticed that when she pushed the connection slightly, the bass would suddenly get richer....tested on a Nano and an iPhone 4S. Disappointing but it's a super-cheap cable so....I missed the Amazon claim window by 2 weeks but Eforcity only covers this for 30 days. Where other companies would send out a replacement, no questions asked, this company does not. Buyer beware.NOTE: the connector did fit into the iPhone even with the case on, which was why I purchased it to begin with.
859, This is probably the second album by the Judds that I had purchased when I started listening to their music in 1992. I have to say that I love it. In 1992, I usually listened to pop and alternative alone, but ventured out  into country and I chose the Judds to do so. Every song on this album, I  thought, really grooved except for &quot;Are the roses not blooming?&quot;,  which is a slow but more contemplative song but a sweet one to end the  album with. The album as a whole, is a real thinker. It dips itself in a  little heart mending, heart breaking and a little social awareness. I  highly recommend this Judd album.
860, First, I took the advice of other reviewers on here and ordered a size larger, but that was a bad idea.  They are not super loose, but they are not like my other compression tights.  A size larger than I normally wear and they are like regular sports tights.Second, I would definitely recommend layering them under sweatpants or warm ups if your temps hover at around 0F.  They are warm, but not super warm for that weather.  I'm sure once Spring comes, they'll be fine for running and staying warm in temps around freezing.I appreciate the extra elastic around the ankle.  They don't hike up and they keep the cold air from coming in at my ankles.The only addition I would make is to add a small pocket.  My other compression tights, from another company, have a zippered pocket at the back which is perfect for a house key.
861, There are a few good actors, but some pretty bad acting. The main female character seems helpless, no spine and the combination of the main male character (Ritter) with his girl friend is not believable.I am a sci fi lover. The story concept is definitely interesting, but the acting was a little off putting. There were more than a few times where I shook my head and said wow, that was bad - I can't believe they said that (writing) and the delivery left me cold (acting).Ivanek (director of intelligence) was a beacon of good acting in the midst of the so-so.Lots of good sci fi potential, bad execution mostly due to the acting.
862, This tub is bulky, but great.  It's like a real tub, and it does fit into a bath tub.  It is highly easy to keep clean.  And has two positions.  One is a reclining position for a younger infant.  In this position I would place a washcloth down before the baby to prevent sliding.  The second position is for infants to sit upright.  Great device.  Is something that could be used for years or passed to family and friends as a hand-me-down.  Well worth the price.  No mildew issues at all.
863, I got this rather quickly after I ordered it and I must say for the price, it's a fabulous product.  It is not too greasy and gave me good coverage until I need to color again.  I did not notice any rub-off on my clothes either so I much appreciate that.  I have black hair so the black blended in quite nicely - no one could tell that I used the stick.  It's also small like a lipstick so I can take it in my purse whenever I need it.  For the price and the gray coverage it provides, you can't go wrong.
864, To be honest the show is not half bad, I only watch because it's free with my prime and it is not like I am not doing something also just to catch up with episodes. I started watching on a very early Sunday morning when the house still quiet and since I am a sucker for cop and medical shows I gave it a shot. The acting is ok, the story lines are ok and the cast is also ok. Nothing to write home about but entertaining for a free, no suspence, easy going cop show and the main charachter is good to look at. :)
865, Okay, first of all, before you read this book, dont get your hopes up and await a book about constant military garble. This book is unlike any Tom Clancy book I've read-it is a moralistic thriller. If you are interested in  books about the salvation of prositutes, and a man destined to avenge the  death of his girlfriend, read this book. But, if your looking for a book  about Jack Ryan, espionage, huge military conflicts and other &quot;vintage  Clancy&quot; literature; I doubt this book is for you. I hope that Tom's  next book- &quot; The Bear and the Dragon&quot; is better than this...
866, I had been monitoring larger mobile chargers to replace my old Kensington and came across the New Trent iTorch. What grabbed me is the combination of mobile charger, flashlight AND laser pointer. You can find a lot of units with the flashlight, but the integrated laser pointer is pretty rare and eliminates the need for yet another gadget.Pros:-Nice fit and finish-Good form, feels good in the hand-Tested 2.5 full charges on my iPhone 5...so right in line with expectations.Cons:-Weakish flashlight. Not that I was expecting a true flashlight, but maybe something a little brighter.-Switching on the flashlight vs. the laser isn't the most intuitive.Overall, a great purchase.
867, These snap on gutter extensions are a must for RV's that don't have them. They just snap on to the existing small gutter extensions supplied by the RV manufacturers.  Keeps those black streaks from forming on the side of your RV. I don't understand a reviewer who stated he's never seen them in 40 years of camping. We had them on our 2007 Jayco Eagle and now on our 2014 Cougar HC 321RES trailer. They are cheap- they work & they just snap on or off.Takes a lickin & keeps ticken.....
868, I bought these because I like this style of wiper blade. I hadn't tried this brand or this specific blade before, but I thought I would give it a try. These never lived up to my expectations. They didn't act like other new blades I have used in the past. They would leave streaks behind with each swipe. They streaks generally evaporate quickly, but brand new blades shouldn't be acting like this. After just a few months, the blades are about the same as the old blades they replaced which were over a year old. I won't be buying these wiper blades again.
869, I had a leak in my tire that accelerated greatly in the cold weather.  I was filling it twice a week to 35psi (from around 15).  I put about 16oz in my tire - Run flat, 255/35/18 (BMW 3-Series Sport Pkg).  Then drove it 4 miles.  That was about a month ago and it is holding at 35psi, with zero vibration even above highway speeds.  I am not sure where the leak was coming from, but I am a true believer in this product.  Saved me up to $400 to replace a single tire.  The built-in tool on the endcap worked great.
870, We've tried at least three different gates in different doorways and entrances, and this one's by far the best. It really is hands-free to open. Better yet, it closes automatically by bumping it shut, unlike some gates that require a hand to *close* them, argh.One complaint I've heard is about the foot pedal breaking off. That hasn't happened for us, and we use two of these, nor has it happened for friends (and friends of friends) who've had one of these for several years. I suspect that anyone's who broke had the gate in the entrance either too tightly or crooked. So, use the tool that comes in the box for checking the tightness, and use a level(ing device) to get it straight.
871, This is a good watchband.  It fits many Timex watches including the Expedition.  The band itself is a canvas strap which I like alot because it "breathes" with me.  The clasp is the end of the band which goes through a plastic loop and fastens to itself with velcro.  Actually my only complaint is that I'm a big guy and the strap, even at its most loose, is a bit tight for me.  I know - lose weight!  So, my overall rating is good, but for me, not great.
872, At long last available on DVD, &quot;Legend of a Band&quot; is the closest the Moody Blues will get to the documentary treatment that the Beatles received in their Anthology.  Although it's already dated eleven years, evidenced by the inclusion of Patrick Moraz as a band member (who left the group in '89/'90), it is a great repository of high-quality vintage performances, home movie footage, and 1990 interviews with the four band members.  Also, this is the only place to find the MTV-style music videos for &quot;Your Wildest Dreams,&quot; &quot;I Know You're Out There Somewhere,&quot; &quot;No More Lies,&quot; and the 1989-remake of &quot;Question.&quot;  This is the closest that the band will come, I believe, to releasing a music video anthology as well as a documentary.  A nice companion piece to the Royal Albert Hall live DVD...now let's just hope this means that the classic and essential &quot;A Night at Red Rocks&quot; concert will find its way onto the digital format.
873, I just watched this last night, and to be frank I don't understand the hate. I felt that Kevin Kline is a hilarious character in this film, he lights up the screen every chance he can get. He did great in this. Paul Dano is also one of my favorite actors, and I thought he did great as well. The supporting characters like John C. Reilly and Katie Holmes did great as well. I found it very entertaining and I would definitely watch it again. I would highly recommend it.
874, I've been using My Fitness Pal for two years now.  The app and the website are great for tracking calories and losing weight.  The app itself is very intuitive and flexible.If you go out to eat, lots of restaurant's menu items are already in the program.  If you cook at home you can create your own meals and recipes.  For exercising you can use the already inputted exercise programs or create your own.Simple, easy to use and it works.  I've lost 60+lbs with this app and will continue using it even after I meet my fitness goal.
875, I love that this gate installs very easily, and the gate swings both ways.  We installed this in a bedroom frame, and easily moved it to over the stairs. I love that it doesn't leave any residue on the walls. Be sure the use the wrench it comes with which makes it very easy.The measurements it gives you are pretty accurate for the max length it can do, our stairway is just over 39" and it barely doesn't fit with the first extension so we had to add another.
876, I am a very loyal costumer of olay.  I buy all their products and I have had great results.  I have combination skin which is somewhat sensitive and so I can't use alot of products out there and not many of the products out there work for me.  Olay is reliable, gentle, effective and alittle goes a long way.  I will definitely continue using olay regenerist and I would recommend this to anyone in need of a fragrance free moisturize for sensitive combination skin.Update:it also works to reduce aging signs at the back of my hand.  It softens my hands and reduces age lines.
877, I am not a fan of Stephen King. He usually tries to slam Christianity every chance he gets so I usually avoid anything he does. Not sure why I gave this a try but I am glad I did. It took a couple episodes for everything to start to mesh but by the middle of the season it was great. I am really looking forward to its return. The only problem is, whenever I recommend it to anyone... they haven't heard of it. Give it a chance and you won't be sorry.
878, I spent 4 months in Tucson, Arizona recently and have an 18' A&E awning, the older style you pull out by hand. Had one of these De-Flapper on each end in the middle and it helped keep the awning material from flapping so hard in the wind. Tucson can get some hard winds, and when I was working 55 miles away during the day, I was worried that I'd come back to the park to find my awning flying in the wind. No dice. These work well, but I wouldn't keep them on if the winds get more than gusts of 15 mph. You can see them in person at Wally World first, but order here to avoid taxes!
879, Very happy with this product.  I initially bought it to try and charge a dead battery, alas it wasn't able to bring the battery back from the dead, but I don't think anything could have.I've used it to restore a charge on a battery for a garden tractor (after the winter), and for a car that hadn't been driven for a couple of months.  Worked very well in both cases.  Very handy and versatile battery charger to have around the house - it charges 6v and 12v batteries, as well as standard lead-acid and high-end AGM batteries.
880, I buy this product for my spouse, who favors it over the Aveeno Lotion Moisturizer. He says that this product stays on with his hydrocortisone cream.He says that the product keeps his hands from drying out and it doesn't easily wash off. Contrary to what I thought, it doesn't leave an oily residue. I prefer to buy it online, as not many local stores stock it. I received the product within the time promised and in excellent condition. I will continue to purchase this product as long as my spouse uses it. I recommend this moisturizing oil to anyone needing long-lasting skin moisture.
881, This is by far my favorite Clancy book, and I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in the Jack Ryan series, or anyone with an interest in military fiction. It is definitely a 4-5 star book.The reason that I give it 3 stars is the Kindle conversion. The formatting is just not professional enough for a Kindle book priced at $6-$7. There are a LOT of misspelled words, and many of them aren't even properly-spelled but wrong words -- they are just gibberish. Also, Clancy makes heavy use of italicized text, which the Kindle version tends to munge up. If it was one or two, I could live with it, but it's at least one every few pages, and some have so many that it distracts from the story.Summary: great story, fantastic writing, just a horrible editing job in the Kindle version.
882, This documentary captures Monk as an artist probably better than any jazz musician has ever been captured on film.  Although many identify Monk with bebop, I have always identified him with his musical compositions and enjoy listening to him best when it is just he playing the piano with no other accompaniment. His compositions remind me of Abstract Expressionist art and he was, of course, around during that vital time. This documentary lets you see all sides of his work and also glimpses of his personal life.  Like most artists and musicians, it is pretty clear that he was not the ideal living companion.  Typically, the biggest thing in his life was his music and nothing else even came close to that as a consideration.
883, My seven year old daughter has become a Beatles fan and so daddy purchased the Beatle albums and available movies, as well as this BBC television production. (Daddy grew up during the era, in both the UK and the USA and is a Beatles fan himself.)An obvious fly by the seat of your pants production, with lines made up as the film was underway and some obvious tenstion between the band members, neither my daughter nor I understand most of what is happening except the Beatles seem to think that "Dewsberry road" is a comical line and my daughter likes the film.If you are a die hard Beatles fan, you might want to have it simply to have it.  If you are not, stick with the album of the same name.The picture quality is poor, at best.  The story line is as close to non-existent as it could be and still seemingly have a story line.
884, Wow!  What a collection.  It opens up with ENDLESS LOVE and only gets better.  From R&amp;B to Disco to Motown.  This album is truly well-rounded and a must-have for everyone!You can hear her vulnerability in songs like &quot;It's My Turn,&quot; &quot;Theme From Mahogany (Do You know Where You're Going To)&quot; and &quot;Touch Me In the Morning.&quot;She'll get you boogie-in' with &quot;Upside Down,&quot; &quot;I'm Coming Out,&quot; &quot;The Boss&quot; and &quot;Love Hangover.&quot;We even get treated with her old Supremes stuff.  A medley of it!  All in one!  You must buy this CD!  It's one of my favorites.
885, We bought this gate a few months ago.  It's generally well made and is sturdier than some other gates.  Overall, it's a good choice, although in my opinion it is a bit overpriced.  An appropriate price for the quality would be around $50.PROS:-Adjustable size-Door swings both in both directions-Door is pretty easy to open-Pressure-mounted (no damage to walls)CONS:-You have to lift the door as you open it.  This gets to be a bit of a pain-Not as sturdy as a hardware-mounted gate... it loosens over time so you do need to take minute to tighten it up periodically.Other reviewers have commented that the bar across the bottom is annoying.  I actually find it to be fine.  You do have to step over it, but it's only about 1" so it doesn't bother me.I will update this review when my baby starts walking... I'm hoping that the pressure mount will be strong enough to hold up to a toddler!
886, Love it, and it is a must in our babies room, but the only drawback is that our wipe warmer (Lion Heart 2004 model) does not fit correctly. To fix this we just taped down the wipe warmer. I love that everything you need can be placed in the diaper depot and so easy to grab one handed of course.Note:We do not use the bottom basket under the wipe warmer as a diaper storage but instead as a cloth towel holder and it works great, especially if you have a boy and need alittle protection and/or clean up from showers! Also our diaper stacker holds more and adds decor to the nursery's theme
887, I started using Aveeno Active Naturals Creamy Moisturizing Oil last winter after my skin dried out. I tried several lotions, but nothing seemed to help. I tried this one and was amazed by how much softer my skin felt. It kept it from drying out and took care of the peeling I was experiencing. I also love the scent. I continued to use it all year long, even in the summer. I have a feeling the dry winter air won't bother my skin this year as long as I keep using this lotion. It's definitely my favorite lotion. I also recommended it to my own mother, and she loves it as well.
888, My dog had suffered itching for two years he is only 3, my vet insists that he is allergic.We tried all kinds of allergy solutions to no avail. My poor dog suffers terribly.Someone just mentioned yeast infection to me and I ran out and bought this product.I gave him a good long shampoo and he actually liked it.  He smells so good too. I was amazed at the outcome.Normally he would me scratching himself to distraction and I would be sitting here getting all upset for him. Instead he is laying next to my leg snoozing and very happy, he has scratched only about three times since the shampooing.I was not expecting a miracle but this is close enough for me.  I know I will have to shampoo him regularly but that is fine with me as long as he is happy.BTW, I bought this OTC from a local drugstore chain, for $11.49 for 4 oz.
889, When I bought the Kindle version of this book on July 25, 2010, it came with the cover art. Now it's been replaced by a generic one. If you buy the printed version, you get the original cover art. The same should be true of the Kindle version. Apparently that is no longer the case. It may not be a big deal to most readers, but it is to me. I feel short-changed and Amazon hasn't helped at all when I approached them with this matter.
890, Never in my life did I EVER want to count calories! But with this a lot of what of what i eat is already imputted though other members. I'm starting to enjoy seeing what I'm doing to myself each day. I especially enjoy the pie chart that shows that percentage of carbs, fats, sodium and protiens I'm consuming everyday.  One bad thing, the weight training. I don't know the names of ill the moves I do (Richard Simmons Totally Toning) so j just end up putting less strenuous walking down. Over all I really like it.
891, This product is hard to find on shelves in my area, on the rare occasion I or my mom would see it we would buy up like 3 bottles at a time. I have just started buying it on Amazon instead. I love that it absorbs quickly and doesn't leave my hands greasy (I HATE having greasy hands) but still leaves my hands feeling soft and moisturized. The scent is light and pleasant, similar to the scent of the other aveeno products. I'll also use it on my legs after shaving and on any other dry/itchy patches I might have on my skin and the oatmeal in it really does seem to help calm the itching.
892, This app is cool. It has a list of a ton of different tech sites which are all there to select from and view. I got the app for free, not sure if I would have paid for it, since it's all basically free content anyway, but I'm a tech guy so I like having everything there at my fingertips to look through in one place. It's a good app, and considering that I got it as part of the free app a day offer, I'm quite happy with it.
893, This case is so great I bought another one.  The main reason I bought this case is the two ways to attach to a belt.  I never trusted just the clip-on style and wanted belt loops.  This fit the bill on that.  What I also can do is slip the end of my headset thru the hole between the flap and the main body and then pull until the earpieces are against the body, and then wrap the cord around the bottom where they join together and snap it closed.  I also have a folded up micro fiber cleaning cloth, cash, and a fold up stand slipped into the card slot.  That main body of the case holds my iPhone (which has an added snap-on case) securely, neither too tight nor too loose.  I highly recommend this product, and in fact ordered a second.  Such quality was very unexpected with such a low price.
894, This is my favorite bra, I have had many of these in several different colors over the years.  I'm not sure if they have discontinuing this bra or not but it's getting harder to find.  I love the size range they offer.  I used to wear a 34 G in this bra but after gaining a little weight I am now a 36 FF.  Simple, sexy, supportive, and it gives me a magnificent decolletage, something a large breasted woman has trouble finding at times!
895, There are no problems whatsoever when it comes to the use and whether the charger works. It does charge and works just fine.However, the only drawback I have with this product is mainly my fault, but to others it's just a warning:The wires on the charger are flimsy and easy to break. I have this charger plugged into a surge protector that sits on the floor, and it broke while I was moving some appliances around. Also, through wear and tear through traveling, the wires are vulnerable to snapping.I'm not sure if other Samsung chargers have a stronger wire, but if not, I hope future chargers improve on the strength of wires.
896, Recently I began experiencing chafing from my seat belt while driving. This is the first time in my twenty-five years of driving this has happened. I suspect that my skin has become sensitive while fighting an allergic reaction to something that has affected my eyes with contact dermatitis.Regardless, the skin on my neck was being rubbed raw where the seatbelt touched it. I found the Sheepskin Seat Belt Shoulder Pad on Amazon and ordered it. This pad is just what the doctor ordered! The sheepskin is soft but not so slick it slides around too much to stay in place. The pad wraps around the seatbelt and fastens with Velcro, but can be easily slid up or down if you need to reposition it while using it - without the need to adjust the Velcro again.Since I started using it a few weeks ago, the rash on my neck has cleared up entirely. I'm considering buying another one for the passenger side.
897, I have this wiper in my garage ready to install when my other wiper needs to be replaced.  I was a little disturbed that the box that the wiper came in was battered, but I examined the wiper and it looked ok.  I contacted Valeo about their warranty and was shocked to hear that I had to deal with the seller (Amazon) for warranty.  Amazon offers only thirty day returns and by the time I install the wiper, the thirty days will be up.  I think Valeo, a well known wiper blade manufacturer, should handle the warranty coverage on their products beyond the thirty days offered by Amazon.  I think Amazon agrees.
898, I've used Mobil 1 and WIX, and although for my other cars I have an otherwise very high opinion of WIX, MANN is the only brand I will use on my BMW as it's the only brand which hasn't crushed upon installation.  The other brands mentioned seem to be a little too tall somehow, the filters twist and crush upon install which compresses half the pleats and stretches the other half, effectively forcing oil through only the stretched portions and reducing overall filtration ability.  Every time I've pulled a MANN filter it's as straight as when I put it in.  Plus they're cheap, and the other brands don't come with an oil pan crush washer.
899, When I have a few minutes for mindless fun, this little app helps kills some time.  Like many free apps, it has the annoying habit of trying to work the upsell, but I assume the developers are entrepreneurs, not philanthropists, so more power to them.  One thing I like is that it does help me think a little more about Blackjack strategies (like holding on a 13 when the dealer shows a possible 16 and would be forced to take a hit, or using splits or the almost worthless &#34;double down&#34;) instead of just a random gut reaction.  Harmless fun.  Maybe a &#34;quick addition&#34; game for kids vs. flashcards ;).
900, I wanted to use this to fill transmission oil into the transmission after performing a filter change and dropping the transmission pan. It broke not even after putting 2 quarts in the pan.. Needless to say that I was not happy as I had to WALK to the next car store to buy a replacement since I coudl not drive with only 2 quarts in the tranny. Buy 2 or 3 to be on the safe side if one fails or use a different solution to begin with. I am using a funnel from now on in combination with a longer plastic tube going down from over the engine.
901, Not too happy with this monitor.  We thought about replacing it early on but it was ok enough to just deal with the static.  My husband became the master of turning it down just enough to tolerate the sounds but hear the baby when he cried.  We used it for 7 months, every day during naps and night, and today the power adapter quit working so the only way to use it is with the 9v battery which lasts all of 3 hours before crapping out.  So, in summary: it will work but it's not a very good product and doesn't seem to have quality components to make it last.  Would probably be a better idea to just to buy a more expensive one out of the gate since you'll be spending that amount of money anyway once you buy something to replace this one when it dies.
902, Ya, Biggies better NYC style rap with battle rhymes, but 2pac is easily the better artist. This album is good MUSIC, no matter what you're into you can get into this album.Method Man and Redman (even INS at the end lol) appear on "Got My Mind Made Up" (my favorite) and Pac uses Meth's "Bring da Pain" chorus on "No More Pain" which is pretty cool.I like "Me Against the World" more, but "All Eyez on Me" is just as deserving of the 5 mic rating it gets and if you give it any less you should stick to all that emo music or whatever the fad is.
903, I've tried more expensive lotions and creams on my face, but I really love this one the best.  It leaves my face feeling and looking very soft.  I also love the way you just press the top and the lotion/cream comes out....you don't have to dip your fingers in a jar or touch what's left in it.  All creams and lotions should be this way...I hate having to dig out cream in a jar with my fingers not knowing if I've left any germs in the remaining cream.  I recommend this.
904, I recommend this show to kids over 8 and adults that like cartoons. I think it is appropriate for kids under age 8 too but they might not enjoy it if they are very babyish and childish. If you like the shows currently on Nickelodeon you probably won't like this. It contains wit and humor that adults may find enjoyable. It is a great 1990s show. It is mildly funny and amusing. If you watched Ren and Stimpy, then you probably remember this and like it. I like the characters and their unique voices. The voice actors who voiced the lead characters are very talented and have worked on numerous other animated shows and films.
905, After 10 months, the watch still works fine after daily use.  Only complaint functionally is that the large, exposed buttons are easy to press accidentally, but no biggie.  But cosmetically, the watch doesn't last.  The silver finish around the face has rubbed off & the plastic face is scratched up (see my posted photos).  I've also owned a light purple version of this watch, which looked even worse after a year - the band discolored and wouldn't come clean.  So, though the watch works fine, I'll be replacing it because it now looks ugly.  I find that Timex watches have a lifespan of a year or less - sure, they keep ticking, but they really look awful after a few months.  So, I've been replacing my watches every year.  Maybe this time I'll learn my lesson and try another brand.
906, This is book five in the A Song of Ice and Fire series by George R.R. Martin. This writer and series is similar in many respects to Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time Series if you like this kind of reading. This particular book in the series, I found to be much more pleasurable reading than the previous book.  The previous book got bogged down in names, places and unnecessary Machiavellian intrigue that tended to make it difficult to follow or did not add to the story at hand. The present book is more concise and keys upon issues of reader interest from previous books and the story. The work flows really well and maintains the reader's intrigue. I think that this particular book is a great read and captures the reader's imagination. I could not put it down.  In all the whole series was very well done and is probably a classic in this genre of fantasy work.
907, I love this app. It works across all of my devices (Kindle Fire, Razr M, and laptop) so no matter what I have or where I am, I can update my diary. It has every food; I have celiac disease and most diet programs don't have many gluten free foods. This one has everything, from Udi's bagels to Glutino pretzels. You can have friends join, so my mom and I can get healthy together. And it takes everything into account...I am disabled, and unlike many diet programs this one doesn't push you do exercise or eat certain things. It just records what you do. No negativity and really simple to use. I love it so hard.I used it two years ago to lose 40 lbs and I'm working now to lose the last 30. I would willingly pay for this app. That it is free is unbelievable.
908, I purchased two Bosch Evolution blades for my 2007 Hyundai Accent on 02/07/2014. Today, 05/19/2014, I finally gave up and replaced them. I have never had wiper blades that performed this poorly. There was almost no contact with the windshield on either side. They left haze and streaks and would spatter water about requiring incessant re-wiping of the windshield to get it to clear. This, the 22&#34; blade frequently chattered and hopped when there was only light moisture. I've never had new beam style wiper blades do that.I purchased these Evolution blades because last season I had a set of Bosch's Clear Advantage on the car and really liked the way they performed. Unfortunately none of the local stores had them in stock when I needed new blades so I thought spending more on these supposedly better Evolution blades would be a no-brainer. With less than 3,000 miles and three months of use I just threw away thirty bucks because I trusted a company to make a quality product.Highly dissatisfied.
909, Utilized these for our stairs and they work very well.  I was surprised how nice they looked once they arrived.  Being able to utilize a step to unlatch the gate is very nice to have, seeing as our kid or some other object seems to be in our hands every time we go up and down the stairs.However, we required two extensions on each of the gates we purchased in order to get to the appropriate width for our staircases so I would recommend making sure you measure your stairs before ordering this gate and the necessary extensions.
910, These straps are exactly as I expected.  I don't know how some of the reviewers expected them to hold a cell phone.  They don't look like they are that big in the photo, unless the photo has changed since their reviews.The cords are small, perfect for the tiny electronic locator I put on my keychain.  They're also a good  size for the charms that go on cell phones or for small thumb drives.Another inconsistency: maybe different vendors provided different straps, but the ones I received have split rings.  They look sturdy enough.  So far, I have no complaints.This was a good value.  I'm impressed and would buy them again, but that won't be for a long while.  I only needed one cord.  I now have ten.
911, Really like the watch - nice value for the money.  It's attractive and practical.  However, the instructions on how to adjust the band are intended for several different models so it was difficult to decipher how to adjust.Adjusting the band was a challenge, but did NOT require a jeweler.  We used a cheap earring post to pop the links apart. You can probably use a pin, but have to be careful not to stick yourself.  It wasn't the easiest thing to do, but wasn't rocket science either.Wife enjoys the watch and isn't concerned about damaging it in normal use.  Good value for the money.
912, Stevie Wonder's meditations on inner city life and the African-American push towards middle-class stability in the wake of the '60s civil rights movement made for some pretty great music... This disc had its share of radio hits and anthemic ballads, such as &quot;Living For The City,&quot; &quot;Golden Lady,&quot; and &quot;Don't You Worry 'Bout A Thing,&quot; but it also has some curious sleeper tunes as well, such as &quot;Misstra Know It All,&quot; which is one of my favorite Stevie Wonder songs.  Oh, yeah, &quot;Higher Ground&quot; is also an amazing funk classic... As is this whole album!
913, This product is a life saver. For those times when the smartphone just will not last an entire day, this product helps me out.  I like how the cable that chargers your phone also serves as the cable that chargers this spare battery.  That is a nice touch that keeps me from having to carry too many cords.  This device is about the same size as a smartphone but has the thickness of a deck of cards. I find though that I can easily put this battery and my smartphone easily into my coat or suit jacket pocket without issue to allow the phone to charge.  The indicator lights on the battery seem accurate, both to display the charging status of the spare batter itself and the discharge rate when it is charging my phone. My only wish for this product is that it would supply 1A instead of 600mA, in order to charge the smartphone faster.  Overall, this is a great product.
914, Although Pac's lyrics are shaky at times on this album, the great production on this album and the classic songs make up for the average joints. This album has more of a commercial feel to it than other 2 Pac albums, but the some of the heart-felt emotions that Pac put into his music are still evident on songs like I Ain't Mad At Cha, Life Goes On and Only God Can Judge Me. IMO, this album is a classic because it was released over five years ago and artists are still capitalizing on the trends, images and concepts that came from this album. It is by far, the most enjoyable 2 Pac album that has been released so far and it will remain in heavy rotation in my CD player for years to come. IMO, this is the only hip-hop double disc that is worth the money. Your Pac collection isn't complete without this classic album.
915, Only good point of this book , his writing skills are still sharp as ever.Now bad points, I dont pay money to read about nothing happening. Plot doesnt go anywhere.There is no character development or movement in the timeline.Coming to violence , he must really have a dark and dreary mind if he cannot write a single chapter of hope, of unsullied dreams. I am tired of reading about his endless sufferings that the good guys have to suffer. By trying to make his bad guys so bad he is making them look like fools. & he is forgotten about the main threat from behind the Wall. There is no appearance of them in the entire novel.I was compelled to write such a scathing review of him because he is a well-establised behaving like he can get away anything.One star is because of the beautiful writing.
916, This series was created from actual case notes, manuscripts, diaries, papers and other ephemera done by and for the Royal London Hospital in Whitechapel.  As a result it is a clear window into the history of the London and into the history of medicine. Heartwarming AND heartbreaking. Frequently disturbing and difficult to watch. Not softened by Hollywood but done in acid by British writers Colin Heber-Percy and Lyall B. Watson. The whole thing is brilliant - the acting, the sets, the costumes, the actors, the scripts... wonderful series!You can also find it by the other names it was produced under: Casualty 1906, Casualty 1907 and Casualty 1909. Searches for `The London' frequently can't find it.You can buy the 4 dvd set - Casualty 1900s  - but only in region 2 so if you are in the US you will need a region free dvd player...
917, This was one of the best space saga's I've read in a very long time!  Red Mars had me hook line and sinker!  Green Mars continued that and I could not wait to get to Blue Mars to see how this was going to end.  I was very upset with Blue Mars though as this book had so much fluff, that I felt the author wrote stuff just for the purpose of filling pages.  That said, I would still recommend this trilogy though to any science fiction fan.  It's almost a "must read" in my opinion.  Well worth my time.
918, I didn't even know a product like this existed until it popped up one day on Amazon. I didn't really know what I was going to use it for, but I wanted to give the idea a try. It turns out that now my thigh-high stockings stay up, and oh my gosh- even my below-ankle socks stay on all day! I didn't think that was possible! It's a lot more tricky to get a shirt or a bra-strap to stay up depending on the material and thickness, but it's possible. I love this product.
919, Great story line & plot of how John Clark became one his main characters in his others books. The story keeps you in suspense through out the whole book. It ranges from drug dealers in baltimore who killed his girl friend & how he took them down, to going to vietnam to rescue downed pilots in a prison camp.John Clark come out as a person who does whatever it takes to get the job done even if it means killing drug dealers to revenge the killing of his girl friend, and he kills a lot of them. This is one great book which is hard to put down once you start it.
920, One thing I didn't understand when I registered for this online is that it's huge! We lived in a small one-bathroom condo when I had my first baby and it was difficult to find a place for this thing since we had to take it out of the tub every time we showered.If you have a bathroom that's just for the baby where you can leave the tub in there all the time, this tub is perfect. If, however, you bathe your baby in your own bathroom, consider getting the Sure Comfort tub that's smaller.
921, Saturday morning is my Roku streaming British tv shows. Husband is asleep. I sit in my recliner with my breakfast sandwich and coffee and flip on Amazon Prime. I've watched Vera, Midsomer Murders, Jack Taylor, but then I discovered Luther.  Without divulging any plots, this is an extremely interesting character, his personal life, and the brilliant detective he is.  In many series you watch, you see characters associated with Luther that you think will last through the whole series.  Don't count on it if you get into watching Luther. It's a suspenseful, gritty detective show, and I look forward to seeing more of the same.
922, I loved this show and even got my wife into it. Now she repels any other tv suggestions I may have. Why? Because they canceled the series! So now Ive got The Event (which I would feel guilty if I said this was great and people went and paid the per episode price, I'm a prime member so I its included). The Event, along with The 4400 to mention another great show that was canceled without any closure, had a lot of different story lines which had the potential for some great stuff.  That is the reason for the hate it rating, producers and executives don't deserve positive credit for shows with great writing and acting that they themselves cancel. I stopped looking to network or ad absed channels for good TV. Of course AMC has some exceptions as does FX. Oh well that's my 2 cents.
923, I tried this when it first came out and was impressed. I have used it ever since. It does seem to even out skin tone and keep facial lines to a minimum. My face also seems soft yet firmer and &#34;hitting 50&#34; (latter part of last month) wasn't as bad as I thought it would be at 30. With the help of this product I don't even think I'm ready for the next step in the Olay treatment line; Pro-X I believe it is. Maybe in a few years &#60;grin&#62;. I use twice a day, in the morning then once again after washing my face in the evening, and I am very pleased with the results. Amazon service is just wonderful and the price beats Costco and any other retail store I have seen. Thanks to Olay for a great product and Amazon for the on time, always in perfect condition delivery.
924, This toilet paper is on the thin side as compared to high end soft toilet paper. So far I haven't ripped through it like I have had some toilet paper do. You will still use more of it than you normally would, but it will still last as there is a lot on the roll. It won't replace toilet paper in your home, but for a travel trailer, where your concerned with not clogging your black water tank, this is perfect. I suppose it would work well in a home that has septic tank issues as well.
925, I bought this to use in homemade body butter because I wanted the butter to be good for hands and nails too.  It works great with the body butter and I had enough left over to use straight on my nails.  I really like it and I think it is helping with the peeling on my nails.  It is a little early to really determine that but I have noticed less peeling lately.  The only change is the body butter and the jojoba oil so I suspect it has played a part in healthier nails.
926, I play on my Kindle Fire and the app is great. the buttons of numbers tell you exactly how much of those numbers are already on board with a small number on the upper right hand side.you can choose your difficulty level and it times you. its awesome and a great way to pass the time. it even highlights the lines for you.if in doubt, try it for yourself. you can always uninstall it.ive had it for a few weeks and it does not crash. no fancy graphics but it's sudoku, there is no need.
927, there are now dozens of apps out  there dedicated to fitness and personal training: running, walking, even weightlifting and eating apps; all designed to help you along in your quest to maintain a fitness regimen for yourself. I found this app to be the best  out there for someone like myself: i like to walk for exercise, and this app provides all the necessary info in a clear and straigtforward approach.  the gps and map tracks each step; voice coaching lets me know how fast and how far;this app is really good on an android phone and it looks good in operation....you can even load your music with it...this app is one of  the more accurate pedometers and gps trackers.
928, Here we have a musical video, featuring Disneyland and all the kids, and not just animation either.  Mickey, Minnie, and the whole crew join in a musical tribute to the sights and sounds of the different areas of Disney - Magic Kingdom, Splash Mountain, and Haunted Mansion, to name a few, and a handful of children to bring it alive.This is a "live action" sing along, and my two daughters really love singing along.  There's something for everyone, including, but a bit dated, song and dance on Main Street, Disneyland.  All in all, thought, it's a great time, and the music grows on you and you really enjoy seeing it over and over.Highly recommended!!
929, On paper this battery should give about 20% more time than the battery that came with my phone.  So far I've had the phone on 3+ days, made some calls, and the charge indicator still shows 4 bars. Needless to say I'm very happy, and for about $5?  What a deal.Not sure why some people are having problems, but the battery came with instructions and I did charge it for a full 8 hours before using it.Note: The battery seems a tad thicker, but the door closes fine.  Just needs a bit of a push.
930, I haven't tried an AI Factory product I didn't like, and this is no exception.  The user interface is competent and nice to look at.  The help is pretty good, but stops short of teaching the game.  I'd love to see this (or a companion title) that includes a tutorial mode.  The AI quickly demonstrated that I know far too little about the game :)  I found on my smaller screen LG Optimus S that the  board did not always sense my touch accurately, but the cross hair indicator let's you know where the piece will drop, a nice bit of UI.  The undo feature lets you back the game up to change strategy, good for beginners like me.  Recommended.
931, I have a very friendly hummingbird that frequents my feeders, hovers above my head and even eats out of my hand from a small test tube feeder. He is attracted to this color (as opposed to a basic red or pink) and always buzzes by me when I wear this shirt.The shirt is made well, but the material is thin compared to older shirts I've owned from FOTL and Hanes. Not really a big deal to me because I only wear this when I am &#34;playing&#34; with the hummingbird.I purchased in XL and it fit snug. With most tees I am too big for a large and too small for an XL.1/2 star taken away for the snug fit and 1/2 star taken away for the thin material.I wish it had a pocket. I would purchase again.
932, My mother has worn her Cuddl Duds tank tops so badly that they are full of holes and falling apart.  I buy her new tops, but she insists on wearing the old Cuddl Duds ones.  The only way I could get her to toss out the ratty Cuddl Duds tank tops was to buy her the exact same Cuddl Duds tank tops, which I did.  She says they are the softest tank tops and that they fit well, without being tight and constricting.  She's had a mastectomy, so fit & comfort are important to her - and nothing will do except Cuddl Duds.  She's not EVER fussy about clothing like this - so Cuddl Duds should consider her loyalty high praise, indeed.
933, As an avowed fan of Marvel movies and fast paced blockbusters, I was very pleasantly surprised by this movie. Intrigued might be a better word. Some plot issues were obvious, such as the theft of their passports and money following his night of drunken debauchery. But others, like the night attack on their convoy, and the encounter in the river (who could have imagined that was a 2 seat F16 in the water, and given what we saw of these creatures, how did it get there?) were pure genius, and not something I expected from this movie. Overall, it was very well done.
934, These nipples worked great at first but about 2 weeks before we were to switch to the next size my grandson started to collapse them and he got a blister on his top lip from sucking so vigorous. When we finally did switch him (at the proper time) to the next nipple he kinda gagged as he wasn't used to getting so much milk / formula.  But we are still using these nipples just might switch him sooner if he starts to collapse the size he is in so he won't have to suck so hard or get another blister.
935, My husband and I have a wooden Go board, and we have been playing for many years.  Even so, I am not very good at it.  This app not only teaches me some good strategy and lets me practice, but it also lets me set the "level" that I want to play.  I love this app!  I would recommend it for anyone that is interested in learning the game AND for anyyone that already knows how to play and is looking for some competition!!!
936, This is one of the two best of the &#34;Flashman&#34; series (the other being the first one: &#34;Flashman&#34;).  To understand the beginning situation, one needs to have read &#34;Flash For Freedom,&#34; as the two stories fit seamlessly together.  In his desperate striving to stay ahead of the law and various revenge-seekers, and somehow get back to safety in England, our hero winds up in an unusual wagon train heading for California, as part of the 1849 gold rush.  His description of the great plains back in what he calls &#34;the earlies&#34; makes you wish you could have ridden beside him, at least through the calmer part of the journey.  But you'll be glad not to accompany him racing for his life across the Jornada del Muerto before a squad of outraged Apaches, or escaping with (most of) his hair from the battlefield of the Little Big Horn.
937, This book strikes me as very fact centered and very realistic creation.  The description of the panorama is very breathtaking.  In spite of all this, there were some inaccuracies that I observed in the facts and  sometimes he forgets that people had to wear their pressure suits (not too  many times though).  But well, I will pass that.  What had not been  developed much, until the very end almost where it became better was the  individual characters.  They certainly lack some human characters and thus  they seem distant and hard to identify with.  The historical, political  aspects were very good, almost as good as the scientific facts.  The  characters, the human touch of this needs to be worked better to get 5  stars.
938, If you've never read any other Clancy novel, read &quot;Without Remorse.&quot;In typical Clancy fashion, Without Remorse is a lengthy novel filled with great characters, lots of suspense, and more! But it breaks from the Clancy norm in that it's not as intricately detailed, technically-speaking, which makes it a great book to recommend to 1st-time Clancy readers.For those who have read other Clancy novels, and therefore may be familiar with the main character, John Clark... or if you've seen the movie &quot;Clear &amp; Present Danger&quot; or the more recent &quot;Sum of All Fears&quot; and recall Clark (played by Willem Dafoe and Liev Schreiber, respectively)... Without Remorse gives you the story behind the deadly CIA operative.Not that I don't thoroughly enjoy the Jack Ryan series, but the Clark character is mysteriously intriguing and telling his history is Clancy at his best. It's my favorite Clancy novel.
939, This game is so realistic! I felt like I was actually playing Blackjack! What is that you say, you detect a bit of sarcasm in my tone? Well aren't you the detective! Five stars to you too! Seriously- its blackjack. How you can have real vs fake blackjack, I do not know, but feel free to clue me in if you know the answer to that one. The game is fun, its always a good primer before you go into the casino and spend your actual money.
940, Normally, I expect stories by Tom Clancy to be about combat, but this book didn't center on that, surprisingly. This book centered on John Kelly, an ex-Navy SEAL grieving the accidental death of his wife. He finds a new love, but she is killed by druggies. So, he takes it upon himself to avenge her death by becoming a vigilante and taking out the street scum and trying to find the killers. There is a respite when Kelly goes on an operation in Vietnam, which fails, but all of the subplots are tied together nicely and the action never ends. I couldn't turn the pages fast enough.It has parallels to such great works as Heart of Darkness, and is not bad.
941, Three good friends - Melanie (the delightful Valerie Bertinelli), Victoria (Wendie Malick), and Joy (Jane Leeves, formerly of Frasier) find themselves stranded in Cleveland, on a flight to Paris (from LA). Their plans to leave change when the girls discover that the local men actually find them attractive. This is a unique experience for the women who are used to being treated indifferently back in LA, where fake beauty and youth is in demand. So they decide to stay, and rent a place, only to discover the place comes with a firecracker in the form of a caretaker, played by the amazing Betty White. The result is some wonderful bantering between the three women and their older, wiser, and yes, funnier caretaker. This is definitely a chick-series, preferably enjoyed in the company of one's girlfriends.There are ten episodes on this DVD:The PilotWho's Your MamaBirthdatesThe Sex That Got AwayGood NeighborsMeet the ParentsIt's Not That ComplicatedThe Play's the ThingGood Luck Faking the GoiterTornado
942, The video and sound quality are really bad on this DVD, but it is better than nothing. I am a HUGE Beatles fan, but I have to say, that this is probably the weirdest movie I have ever seen in my life. After watching it, I can't tell you what the plot is, but it does have some interesting videos. I guess the idea of this movie is that a bus takes people through their different dreams. If that isn't what it's about, I told you I didn't understand it. lol.The two highlights of the film are the two segments for "The Fool On the Hill" and "I Am The Walrus". Those two things are reason enough to buy the movie. Paul looks really cool standing in front of the piano playing the bass during Walrus. Strangely enough, John and George are hardly on the movie. It is mainly just Paul and Ringo.
943, This tub is really nice.  The contoured area for the baby is just right, and it seems really safe.  My baby hated baths until I bought this tub, and now he is much happier.  I like this tub, but I agree with other reviewers that the drain is slow.  Also, the hard plastic is unpleasant for the baby, so I also bought the Safer Bather cushion.  I realize now, though, that I really didn't need that...a soft washcloth or cloth diaper would be enough.  I recommend this tub to anyone who wants to have good control of the bathing situation.  I feel much more at ease using this than I did using the sink because I know that my son is not going to slip into the water.
944, While I don't normally watch this type of British comedy, I was surprised to find it on Amazon Instant video and missing my British TV I decided to watch it and found it enjoyable. I just wish Amazon would get in more British programs like Midsomer Murders, Vera, Scott & Bailey, Casualty; comedies like My Family, Vicar of Dibley, Keeping Up Appearances or even older ones like Open All Hours and Are You Being Served.  Quality programs not over the top stupid like they have on BBC 3.
945, Classic album. One of my favorite of all time. This cd is so good that i feel like buyin it again, i just cant get enough of it. Every song is off the hook. From my personal favorite Ambitionz Az A Ridah to the hit single California Love. Most two Disc cd's that i own are usually just ok, but this one is a club banger. Its a shame that pac went so fast, he could of been a even bigger force than he was. Overall, I give this album 5 brickettes.
946, big black is just one of those bands that is great to have in your collection if ya want something that has no formulas and if you are sick of the same (...). what this album is  the anti music music album.hosted buy steve albini this one is just full of lofi numbers to cause even the strongest of listeners to question weather this band is insane or brillant..i think no reveiw could do this album justice .so ill leave it as if you really are in the mood for something that is really different and kind of on the page of hateing music in general.this one breaths fresh air for music lovers and musicians alike..at least to me its a breath of fresh air..ahhhhhhhhhhh
947, This tub will support your itty bitty newborn but its just too large. I ended up using a small tub that sat on the sink which allowed me to wash my daughter in an upright position so I didnt have to bend over and get achy knees from the bathroom floor. I had read all the reviews it seemed as tho this was the tub I must have! But at my Babies R Us store they did not carry it so I ordered from another store for additional cost- I think I ended up spending close to $50 between the $30 tub, taxes and shipping costs when I couldve saved all that time and money and been so much better with a 14.95 tub...which she still can use now at 6 months. My advice is to buy a smaller tub that you can use in the sink- save your back and spare your knees now because you wont always have the luxury of bathing your child this way long.
948, We have two of these that we rotate and they work just fine for us. We also have the contoured changing pad by Simmons. True, they do seem a little small straight out of the dryer (the cover stretches straight across the top of the pad), but after one changing our baby's weight shapes it right into place. That's really never bothered me. And considering how often they are washed, they are really holding up well.My only complaint (and why I didn't give it five stars) is that they could be a little softer.
949, I replaced a rear sensor in a 1999 camry 4 cyl with this sensor to eliminate a check engine light failure.  It was easier than using an identical replacement because the cable ran through the floor pan under the driver's seat.  By using this I just cut the wires underneath the car, spliced them with included splices and heat shrink and added a layer of self-sealing rubber tape to protect and waterproof the splices.  No more check engine light for about $30.Update: Replaced the rear sensor on my 1998 camry also with perfect success - they went bad on both cars at around 120000 miles.
950, In 'Without Remorse,' Tom Clancy tells us the background story of CIA legend Mr. Clark. Six months after the accidental death of his pregnant wife, John Kelly pulls over and picks up a young girl standing by the side of the road. Kelly falls in love with Pam as he helps nurse her back to help. Pam reveals that she was a teenage runaway that was made into a drug addict so that she would become a prostitute to make money for a group of drug dealers. Kelly wants to see who these people are and where they operate at, since he has friends on the police force in the city where Pam was a prostitute. As they are patrolling the neighborhood, they are spotted by the drug dealers. Kelly is shot and left for dead and Pam's body is found a few days later in a public park. Kelly decides to rid the city of the drug dealers his way - killing each of them with a different weapon so the police won't have a M.O. to go off of.
951, Awfully reasonably priced, this mascara is almost perfect.  I read the reviews before ordering it.  Some reviewers felt it clumped; that problem was easilyapproachable by following the package instructions to apply second and later coats before the previous coats dried.  I also poled my Facebook Friends; they liked this product.  Thirdly, the results in the mirror were excellent, EXCEPT . . . and this problem I have not yet solved--and therefore will probably go back to my more expensive previous brand.  It is very, very hard to apply this mascara without getting bits of it on your skin where you don't want it.  Cleaning those mars up causes smudging--a mite too smouldering a look for me.
952, I had this video on vhs when I was a kid and ordered it for my son recently after our trip to DisneyWorld in August. He liked what he saw and loves videos with music.Sadly the disc that was sent by Amazon with my prime membership stopped working during the Main St USA song(Everytime same spot)! He was so disappointed. I thought maybe it was the laptop I played it on so we tried the dvd system in the car and our blu ray player. I am returning it, but little hesitant to order another (so I will have to think about it).
953, I don't write many reviews, but the New Trent product line deserves a shout-out.A small, well-built battery charger that is reliable and powerful. Uses a standard 110 wall outlet to charge, and my Droid Razr was completely recharged almost 3  times.Comes with a USB cable for Droids and a cable for the Samsung Galaxy.The bells and whistles, i.e. the laser pointer and the LED flash, are handy.The bright blue 4 bar LED charge counter (lo, med, med-hi and full) allow you to check with a touch.I went with New Trent because I couldn't find a negative review, and I can see why.
954, I bought this product to keep my motorcycle charged between rides.  I ride the bike pretty often so I probably don't need it but it does come in handy for those occasions when I go a week or more without riding, like when I am doing upgrades or repairs to the bike.  I just plug it in the night before a ride and in the morning the battery is fully charged and ready to roll.  Great product for a reasonable price.  I really like the jumper cables and keep them in  my saddle bag in case of emergencies!
955, Pros: Works well as a battery, probably has enough charge to last my GalaxySIII through 2-3 days of extra charging w/o having to recharge the deviceitself. Small size/lightness makes it extremely portable/pocketable.Smooth and attractive exterior design. Feels sturdy enough in my hand.Laser pointer and LED light are both bright and have good range when tryingit out in a dark room.Cons: Its a bit tricky switching between battery on/off, laser, and LEDlight. Its not as intuitive as I would like (maybe its just me), but as a bundle device, it worksfine. The on/off button feels a bit flimsy.
956, growing up in chicago in the 60's and 70's, i was fortunate to see and experience many great bands of the era for cheap/the first time i saw traffic, i had front row seats and it was magical/this dvd in santa monica is a realistic representation of this talented group of musicians of the early seventies/the close-ups of chris wood playing the flute and sax are very special to me/what is nice about a concert dvd, is that you can turn off the tv and listen like a cd/a nice addition to my i-pod classic/get it while you can//peace
957, We got this style because we didn't want to attach hardware to our door frames. The step is now noisy, which I may be able to fix with some WD40 or something, but I just haven't tried yet. We also have another gate that is a slightly different The First Years model than this. I like that that one has the plastic guard at the bottom to act as a transition. I've kicked the bottom bar while going through many times! The opening of this gate is also slightly narrower than the other gate. This one is also a little taller. Overall it does the job, but if I had to purchase again I would buy the other First Years model instead.
958, I had never heard of this product before I came across some reviews of top beauty products on makeupalley.com. Folks raved about the power of this little tool. At $47 I was hesitant but decided to ante up. And I am so glad I did.The #11 buffer is an outstanding tool. Used dry, you simple rub it across your feet. Dry skin quickly sheds off leaving a soft smooth surface. I follow the buffing with a good moisturizer and tuck my tootsies in socks. The results are smooth, soft pampered feet!The price may seem high at first, but a pittance when you think of all the money you would have spent on pedicures.The tool is designed to last for years and after use a quick wash with a small soft toothbrush and soap will have it ready for the next use.An excellent value!
959, This holds our wipe warmer and about 2 days' worth of diapers, so far so good.  However, the side containers really don't hold much.  We can fit diaper cream on one side, and our little man's brush and baby lotion on the other.  I keep hand sanitizer and lotion for me on the changing table between the pad and the edge of the table.  Wish it would hold a little more, but it's great to have the things it will hold within easy reach of our son while we're changing him.
960, Purchased from Eforcity, US seller that I've gotten a few items from before and quality was good for the price.  Not this case.  Item is the proper fit, and fits bumper cases or special cases that would only accept an Apple headphone jack (ie thin).But, at first, I was getting audio from just one channel - Jiggling a bit the cable at the base of the male end, 2nd channel started working but was getting static noise by just moving the cable.Audio would then come and go, by briefly moving the cable.Filed claim for damaged item.  Seems to me a $1.70 down the drain.
961, Innervisions is one of those albums where i can listen to from start to finish and and whatnot and not miss a thing. Stevie Wonder is one of my musical heroes and i mean that from the perspective that his music has been a part of my life for a real long,long time. living for the city alone showcases his vocals, instumentation and the story-telling that is timeless of his. i mean he has a way of putting words and music together like so few others before or since.  this album has gotten worn out by me over the years and the textures of his vocals and music along with his words are a big part of that always move my soul. a must have album from a truly Gifted Musical Genius.
962, This is a totally underappreciated piece of filmmaking.  The opening magical mystery tour montage is worthy of any art film. and, that midget was very cool. But, what is perhaps the best bit of the film (come to think  of it, there are two)the bit with the spaghettiand i am the  walrus.those two things are reasons enough for you to buy this treat for  the eyes.  just make sure to look not to your left but to your right when  you watch this bizarre wonder that is MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR.ps: the dream  bit is also great because you see Ms. Winters in a brassiere.  Oh, mercy.
963, These pants were a bit of a suprise because the sizing chart was correct! (If you've bought clothes on Amazon it always seems to be somewhat of a dice roll). They are a touch long in the legs, but I am a weird size when it come to pants, however the leg cinches allow you to tighten extra material at the ankles or around boots etc.  The waist was spot on.Two storage pockets along your legs will allow you to carry light items/gear which is very handy, and the overall material seems sturdy. I have admittedly only worn them once so far, and will be using these primarily for hunting in the upcoming falls season(s). I am however considering both another pair of these, and ones of other colors. Examining the stitching I can see a few areas that may require reinforcement but overall the stitching does appear sound. They are well worth the money.
964, When I saw the creator of this app, I knew immediately that I was going to like it because I'm addicted to their Bingo app.  Needless to say, I was not disappointed and I'm now not only addicted to their Bingo but I'm addicted to their Blackjack too!! Its fun, fast, fresh and easy to use! I highly recommend this app to any Blackjack fan! Even my mom has it on HER Kindle now because she saw me playing with it on mine and it was so simple that she learned how to play 1 2 3!! And so can you!!
965, This product is so cool. It covers the grey at my temples and around hairline perfectly. The color is perfect for my hair. I color with Nice N Easy Dark Neutral Blonde. It stays until I wash it out, but I reapply every morning even between washes, due to face washing, as I use right along the hairline mostly. There is no scent and the product is like a heavy lipstick or concealer makeup. Will definitely purchase again, but it will be a while, this is a lot of product for a little price and I don't have to use much at all for my needs.
966, I got exactly what I was hoping for - a simple inexpensive baby monitor without all the bells and whistles. The transmitter is downstairs in the baby's room and the parent receiver is upstairs in the kitchen. No, the sound quality is not perfect but it is great for the price. I can't hear every breath she takes but I can hear when she's in her bed playing and I can hear when she's crying. I don't get any static.My only real complaint with this is that it takes a 9V batter (or can be plugged in) but the battery is not rechargeable. I usually have it plugged in so I can't comment on how long the battery lasts.
967, Bought this for my 2 yr old daughter. She loves brushing her teeth at the same time i do mine. She was not too sure about the taste of this toothpaste. The previous gel we used was kind of sweet, she got used to it. She thought this was different and was cautious for the first few times. The gel is minty to taste and leave nice minty breath. It is child safe as it doesn't have harmful stuff like fluoride. Surely worth a try if you're looking for a new tooth gel for your little ones.
968, This ear cuff certainly looks great, whether worn low as pictured or higher up. And it's very easy to put on. Which means it's very easy to take off... or, rather, come off when you don't want it to (say, for instance when you're sleeping or brushing your hair). I adjusted the tightness with pliers after putting it on, thinking that would get it to stay put; it helped, but didn't solve the problem  entirely. Bottom line, it's a fun and attractive accessory - it just has limits.
969, I got this tub on the advice of previous reviews and have to agree it's great.  It is big, I store mine on it's end in our linen closet and set it on the kitchen counter for baths.  My girls slipped around a little on the infant side until I put a burping cloth under them.  The wet fabric helped keep them in place.  My only complaint is the drain plug must have been stuck in backwards.  The force of the draining water blows it closed so I have to prop it open by sticking a pair of scissors through the hole.
970, What the negative (and often hilarious) reviews of this book failed to capture for me is the fact that I found this much, much better than A Feast for Crows.  I suppose it's mainly that Crows was so unrelentingly dark. Plus you had to listen to @#$@# Cersei.  Ick. This is less dark, with little bits of hope, and even the detestable character (Reek) becomes moderately likable.(Spoiler, but trying to be vague:) There are two plot twists mid-book where characters who ended Crows badly suddenly get a better deal. Doing the two in sequential chapters was unconvincing.  It left me annoyed wondering, "Is anything else you led us to believe totally wrong, George?"Now how many years do we have to wait for the next one?
971, I had read about this same problem in a review before I bought these but I thought it was just a fluke. I had mine for a little over a month and the plastic that holds the right speaker on broke rendering the headset useless. It looks like I can return them and I would replace with another but I don't want to keep replacing them because of a design flaw.Sound quality WAS great for music. These are good if you want music headset that you can answer a phone call if you have to. But if you intend on talking on the phone with much any back ground noise this might not be the one.
972, The first thing I noticed about this moisturizer is how smoothly my foundation went on after using it.  (I used to feel as if my moisturizer and face makeup were too much for my 48 year old face.)  I'm looking forward to the possible fading of age spots in the future with continued use.The price is better than Wal-Mart's if you subscribe and it really is a convenience.  If you run low before you're due for a shipment you can adjust the delivery.  I also subscribed to the eye cream and night cream.
973, I received this as a gift and I'm going to buy it for every expectant mother I know.  We attached this right to the side of the changing table that came with our pack and play and it holds everything you could possibly need while changing your baby.  We hated the thought of having diapers and supplies just laying around downstairs, but were not about to run upstairs to the nursery every time we needed to change the baby.  This solved the problem...everything is right at our fingertips for diaper changes.  It also keeps our dog from going after diapers!
974, I bought this product based on a BBC documentary about products that really work in reducing fine lines. Thankfully I have few lines, but figured it was good to get on top of the game, and I also liked the fact that it offered UV protection which is the number one reason for getting lines in the first place.I like the way it dispenses and feels on my skin at first, but I noticed that it does not get absorbed quickly enough for me. I consistently sweat the stuff off after applying it. I think it's just too greasy and thick for me. I usually have dry skin, so you would think it would be perfect, ...I will finish what I have of it and then go back to my Boots No.7 Protect & Perfect.
975, The gate is decent construction, and the lever has enough weight where only an adult can open it.  The mounts aren't sturdy.This gate only fits in our doorways, and this is with the extensions maxed-out to their maximum length.  This doesn't make for a secure fit in our doorways, and it is unusable anywhere else.  It's too small.  It fits soundly in doors less than 30&#34; in width, so measure your doorway before you buy.The mounts do not securely fasten onto the gate, so when you move it from doorway to doorway or when installing, these fall out of the gate, and you have to balance these during installation.Yes, there are extensions available, but these are sold as an accessory, and with the combined cost, there are other better options available.I don't recommend this product as we replaced it with a simpler, lower-cost solution. Save yourself.
976, This is a great DVD, although I wasn't aware of the butchering of The Electric Co, incidentally the best song on Boy and my personal fave.Too bad - all over royalties?Anyway, if you're a fan of the Boy album, as I am, and have been waiting for years to see these songs performed live, this is it.An Cat Dubh, Twilight, A Day Without Me, I Will Follow, Out of Control - all here.An Cat Dubh - what a phenomenal tune - takes me back to 1980.Or was it 1979?Not to mention Party Girl and the great 11 o'clock Tick-Tock.And The Electric Co still sizzles with The Edge laying down those ending power chords over and over, waiting for Bono to get back on stage and finish the song proper.Catch Bono muffing the end of the first verse with the "spoon fed" lyric from the second verse instead of "shout, shout your insides out."Well worth the $14.99 the local Best Buy is charging.Somebody try something quick.
977, I really love this app.  I have it on my iPhone, my computer, and now my Kindle Fire so that I can take it with me wherever I go.  It also syncs with my BodyMedia armband (they have others they sync with now as well as you can see on the site).  I have lost 17 pounds so far and it keeps me accountable.  So now I know how many calories are left and if I should have that extra &#34;little something&#34; or not.  Great app for anyone wanting to keep track of calories easily.  It always has the food that I want to find....the food list is endless.  But you can get through with just a brief description and it will take you to a list with the most relevant first (or you can choose the name first and search that way).  It's free and definitely worth a try.  I don't think you will be disappointed.
978, I love these books but this... this was not my favorite. To be fair, this man keep SO many plots and characters in the air at any one time that there just had to be a point where he'd have to start wrapping things up. Logically, I know this to be true. My advice for the brave reader who is thinking about taking them on is to not worry about losing track of details. Martin does a great job of reminding the reader who everyone is as he goes... just keep plugging along and you'll be fine.
979, These see mto be the best spark plugs for my Tiburon GTI love them. as soon as i installed them i noticed some throttle response improvement and it only increased as time went on cause of ECU adaptation. I also checked long term and short term fuel trims. prior to the spark plugs my LTFT varies from +8 to +12 which is not good at all. it's been a couple of months since i bought these plugs and i checked the LTFT yesterday. it was +2.2 to +3.4the car runs much better now. highly recommend these plugs!
980, I was so happy to find this movie but the price was outrageous.  I got it for my sisters birthday because her and this movie go way back.  I guess it was worth the amount of money just because in my family it is a classic.  They really need to make this movie on a DVD though because they last longer.  This movie is so funny and just amazing. If you haven't seen it then I would suggest you rent it first because you may not be into this kind of movie.  It is kind of trippy in some parts but the whole movie is just great.  There is some singing and it is mostly a cartoon.  It starts off as real life but then turns into a cartoon.  This movie is a classic.
981, I won almost every time, takes a bit to get used to all the betting buttons and I lost big because I bet small but on the wrong button and lost 17,000 chips which was almost all my winnings, then I got it back up there again betting big and then finally bet really small just to play for fun.  This game is great to me because you win, but if you don't it's a buy chips with your credit card game.  It also sells you other games which I took the free dls of, bingo and video poker since I won so much on this one.  But it's just another show up every day and then pay to play game.  But lets you bet big and of course move up in level quick at start like all pay to play games, that's how they hook ya.  Worth a try if you like black jack.
982, My experience was not like any the reviews I read. The packaging, the product - it all came the way it was supposed to. New. It only took a little over a week for it to be clumpy and gunk up my lashes. After wearing it all day I would have super cute dark rings under eyes. So obviously it couldn't even stay put. After a few weeks of daily use its almost gone. I only paid maybe nine dollars, but I was hoping for something better. I'm not sure what it would take for me to try it again. Overall , this mascara was a stinker.
983, After several love affairs with other well-known lip balms, I wanted something that was actually moisturizing my lips instead of making me feel like I needed to constantly re-apply.  This lip moisturizer is unscented, does not make your lips tingle, is long lasting, and is great on its own or under lipstick. My lips no longer crave lip balm, nor do they have dry spots or cracks.  This is now my go-to balm and I have to buy it in multiples to ensure I have them in my bag, in my car, at work, at my bedside, all over.
984, I put a set of these on my Alfa 164 and have been extremely pleased with the performance.  Other standard blades tend to judder and make a lot of noise on the Alfa.  I tried bracketless blades which, besides being ugly, did not work well and left a huge streak of water down the middle.The Valeo's clear my windshield exceptionally well and, just as important, glide like silk with no noise or chatter.  Will see how well they hold up over time but for now they get two thumbs up.
985, When I bought my wife an HTC One X, it was the first phone we had owned that did not have a removable battery. I did some research, read many reviews, and bought the iTorch, IMP52D.Am I ever glad I did.It is small enough to fit into my wife's purse (without complaining about the size or weight) and packs enough juice to charge the phone a few times over, before the iTorch needs to be recharged itself.I've even "borrowed" her iTorch when I don't want the hassle of changing out batteries when my Galaxy S3 gets low on power.The LED light and laser pointer are nice extras. The LED has enough light to see things I've dropped in the movie theater!I would definitely buy this little workhorse again!
986, This is an original piece of horror fiction using a tried and true premise; outsider goes to a small town, uncovers secrets and weird things going on, a race against the ticking clock, etc.Muriel gray does a great in-depth job about this trucker who is carrying an unknown cargo and just writes a great novel. She is a new writer and is one to watch; she has all the tools to scare and frighten.She writes at a break-neck speed and keeps the obstacles coming. The twists and turns are &quot;realistic&quot; and she does a credible job at shaping her characters.Definitely a writer to watch!!
987, Eurythmics / Greatest Hits (DVD videos):  The only way, so far (as of Jan. of 2012), to get ALL of the Eurythmics best songs is to buy every one of the Eurythmics albums because their anthologies are all incomplete and unsatisfying.  I do not want ALL their album for, as good as they were, they had a Lot of filler in their albums.  Therefore, this DVD of their video hits is about as good as you're going to find until (and if) they release a Proper anthology (which will have to become available After January of 2012 because all those before this date simply stink).This DVD is good enough but has some very odd `between videos' stuff which at times gets in the way of the beginning and or ending of a video.  Overall, it is good.  Four Stars.
988, Of course this is one of the very all time greats, and the Universal double CD deluxe edition of some years ago had a very good remastering job. But as usual, Mobile Fidelity has produced an amazing remaster that has a true analog sound with superb warmth and incredible detail at the same time. A rich, vivid tonality and not even a hint of digititis are the hallmarks of the MFSL sound, and of couse, they only remaster direct from the original analog master tape (unlike the dubious sources of other "huffy" celebrity wannabee engineers) - and it shows.Worth every penny. Just get it. It can never sound better.
989, While a very entertaining and humorous series it sadly ended just after four years on Fox,  but low and behold thanks to the fans we now get to enjoy new seasons again.  The characters are still as endearing as when they first aired and I'm truly grateful the original cast agreed to come back and do the voices again for these beloved characters.  Though the set is a little short with just thirteen episodes it is forgivable on both the price and quality of the series in general. The series gives us the humor like we saw in the very early years of another iconic series the Simpsons.  While it does go a little more adult oriented humor it doesn't reach the level of Family guys controversial yet funny style of humor which seeing the series from the very beginning is appreciated.  The series will definitely appeal to the fans of the series or fans of the Simpsons but for others I do suggest checking out a few episodes online to see if it's a series you would enjoy which you'll most likely will.
990, I just bolted this onto my 99 Jeep XJ and so far it's doing what it's supposed to do. Fit perfectly out of the box. Comes with the hardware for the press-fit stud but not the bolt/nut on the axle end, so be careful removing the old stuff. I recently lifted the XJ and put 31s on and the old stabilizer was allowing too much bump-steer on uneven terrain so this suddenly became necessary. After driving around with it on, it seems to perform as well as the more expensive ones I have used in the past for similar applications. Hopefully the durability is also comparable or better. Luckily I remembered to paint it green before I installed it, so now I get better gas mileage too.
991, I purchased three different belt for work when purchasing this one, thinking I would send back any non contenders, however I decided to keep this one for when I dress up . The belt is smaller in width then what I am use to which is nice because it gives it a more stylish look. I wear a size 38 and this belt leaves just enough to tuck the buckle to the belt with little excess once fastened. The buckle and metal end are finished nicely with no rough ends. The slid clasp works well with no catching when I release it. It is a bit stiff which is common for these style of belts until broke in.
992, On a recent trip the IMP500 recharged my cell phone and operated and recharged my Nook color reader twice without needing recharging itself.  The Nook color reader has about an 8 hour battery life on its own. Using the IMP500 I was able to continue reading past 12 hours, plus it was 3/4 charged when I disconnected the NOOK. The IMP500 perfomed as advertised. It's easy to use and light to carry. When using the NOOK reader, I just dropped the IMP500 in my shirt pocket connected to the reader by the NOOK USB cable. I highly reccommend acquiring a short pocket if you do not already have one. Recharging is fairly quick with any of the standard usb chargers (the one it comes with, the NOOK charger, or an Apple IPhone charger).  This is good, since it measns carrying only one charger.  This is a simple device that solves a major problem of not havng enough battery life in the devices you carry. It also charged my iTouch-4 with no problem on th esame trip.
993, I hate lotion. It's sticky when you put it on, takes forever to dry (if it dries at all), and many times smell strange, even if it's supposed to be unscented. This oil is a perfect alternative for someone like me who needs to have their skin moisturized, but don't want to deal with all the negatives of lotion. I can barely smell this oil, which is great for my allergies, and it feels like liquid silk going on. I wipe excess water from my skin, then apply this oil, pat dry with a towel and spritz some Yes to Carrots Body Mist all over. My skin simply glows, and it's more moisturized than when I was using lotion. I would recommend this to anyone. You'll be hooked!
994, I had a pair of shoes like these that I wore until they nearly fell apart. They were so very comfortable, and worked well with different types of outfits, including shorts and capris. The only problem, (which other people have mentioned), is that they do tend to run narrow, so I would suggest buying them a width wider than you normally do.For a relatively inexpensive shoe, I think that they are a great value.Addendum: I now have three pairs of these shoes, in different colors. Except for the times that I need to wear sneakers, I find that I am wearing a pair of the sandals, to the exclusion of all my other shoes.Update: I now have four pairs of these shoes. No matter what I am wearing, I seem to always go back to one of these "Mimosas".
995, I've read reports of this case not fitting properly for the 8330 specifically but it worked fine for my 8330 example. There are some minor diferences between the other 8300 models and the 8330 but again my case actually fit fine. Makes the BlackBerry VERY Robust! Adds a little bit to the form factor but not enough to outweigh the protection. If you need the most protection available for an 8300 series this is it bar none. The clear plastic will blur the camera some I've noticed; you probably could cut out around the lens and get the clearness back without risking too much. I'm leaving mine sealed up the way it is. I need every ounce of protection this thing provides.
996, I registered for this item because it goes with the changing pad that I chose.  I can't believe that this cover is made by the same manufacturer as the pad!  It doesn't fit well.  It has no holes for the safety straps on the pad to fit through.  I cut small holes to pull the straps through, and they were all frayed after just one washing.  In fact, the entire cover is already covered with frays and snags after only two weeks of use!  The material is rough and cheap.  My husband and I have opted for covering the pad with a clean bath towel every day.  It's softer and easier.  We will look for another option, but until we find one, this cover is not the answer!
997, I bought season one THE GLADES on spec, to see if I liked it.  I do like it.  It's not awesome television, but for me the characters are interesting and the writing is pretty good.  When season two came out I bought that too.  I have a weakness for police procedurals.  I'll probably buy season three THE GLADES.  There is a good writing team behind this series, and the actors know their stuff.  Not sure if I will ever re-watch any episodes, but hell, I never re-read Jack Reacher novels either.  @hg47
998, I've been using Maybelline mascara for what seems like over twenty years. How time flies. I have tried other mascaras but they just seemed more messy than this one. As long as you let this dry before you rub your eyes you probably won't have a problem. This is however a more thickening mascara. It does nothing for length. I like this mascara because my hair is brown and the mascara matches my hair and eyebrows. It also creates a very natural look unlike the lengthening types of mascara. Inevitably I do rub my eyes while wearing mascara and this one doesn't create too much of an issue. It only slightly darkens under my eyes but it is not very noticeable. If you are going to watch a sad movie while wearing mascara this is also a good choice since it is waterproof. It removes easily withMaybelline Expert Eyes Mascara Remover, Moisturizing. Just also wash your face with whatever you normally use as the remover tends to be a little oily. Otherwise it is great.~The Rebecca Review
999, I am still learning this program, so I can't give it five stars yet.  I don't have anything to compare it to, since I haven't used one before.  But, it seems to do what I want so far.  It is a little confusing at times as far as figuring out the calories and the directions aren't as clear as I would like.  But, as I am going along things are beginning to make sense and I am really loving the way it is keeping track of things.  I just figured out yesterday that it will tell me if I am eating too much sugar or there is too much fat in my diet.  Down the road, I am sure I will be changing my rating to five stars.  At least if I don't die from starvation first. Lol. Just a diet joke.
1000, More than any other band of the video era, DEVO knew how to capitalize on the form. Their "The Men Who Make The Music" was shown on arthouse type cable shows before most peole even knew what music video was! I consider this to be an essentail part of any music vid library (AND PLEASE SOMEONE GET IT ON DVD!!!). Granted, the production values are way primitive compared to what followed in the decade, but the level of enthusiasm DEVO brought to the form has rarely been matched. And let us not forget the noteworthy perfomances of Larraine Newman and Spazz Attack.You get "Whip It" for the plastic energy domes, "The Day My Baby Gave Me a Surprize" for the potatoes playing the hippo's teeth, Barbi and Ken in their great big fight during "Love Without Anger"...are you a Spud? Even if you aren't, you must have "We're All Devo."
1001, The main premise of this show appears to take the actor with the least screen time or interaction with the star and make them the guilty party. A 1970's novel style that quickly annoyed people by having them read several hundred pages before introducing the killer on the next to last page. The main character is likable and the relationship with the nurse is oft-times weird and disjointed, but the supporting cast makes up for the obvious flaws and inconsistencies that abound and annoy. I've been binge watching it and do find myself checking the time, playing Frost, or looking up baseball scores while it's on, so take it for what it's worth. I guess its better than network TV, but not by much.
1002, Hello there hip-hop fans  * * * * beware, no fake copies of albums aloud in your cd racks people. * * *now im only doing this reviewer a short one because what more can you say. every1 has this album already and if they dont, they'v heard just how damn right brilliant it is and dont need telling be us.i have all the tupac (apart from all them new one's produced by dr, dre and eminem) and i would say that this is one of his masterpeace's and is a most have in any collectoin.with plentty of diffrent artist's featured on the album from kurupt and daz too red man, mathod man, and snoop doggy dog.i would say nearly every hip-hop fan out there will like this album so go buy it.
1003, This cd is awesome and its amazing that the Tempts are still going and going strong. Can't help but to think what could have been had Paul, David, Eddie and Melvin lived. But I don't want that to take away from the guys that are in the Tempts now. This cd is so smooth and romantic that you can't help but to fall in love with this cd. Plus, the guys look great. If you are a serious R&amp;B fan, then this cd is a must!!
1004, The app has been updated and now it works correctly on the Xoom.ORIGINAL REVIEW:This app sort of works with the front-facing camera on the Motorola Xoom.  The preview doesn't work right, everything looks all stretched and distorted, but when it actually takes the pictures, the result looks normal.I suppose the $2 cost of the app is less then what a set of photos from a real photobooth would cost, but this app doesn't seem to have much use beyond its single, kitchy purpose.
1005, I LOVE this app- it helps you easily calculate the calories you're taking in (through the simple search or my fav the barcode scanner) , the calories you get back through exercise, your weight & measurements, and at the end of the day it tells you what you would weigh in 5 wks if every day was the same calorie intake- its definitely a motivator to see the lower weight and know that in 5 wks you could be closer to your goal. It also warns you if you didn't eat the minimum suggested calories for the day, which is important. One of the best things about the app is that it breaks down every nutrient and how much you have had of each( calcium, sugar, Vitamin A, etc) and tells you if you've used too much- this has really opened my eyes to the different nutrients that I never really paid attention to when I was doing points plus. Can't do with out it!
1006, Very expansive database of foods, do not have to waste time adding new foods. Exercise calories automatically increases daily allowance which is great. Does not take a lot of time to log which makes tracking easy. My only issue is the community can be snarky at times and strange. I don't understand that. You would think people would be encouraging. I stay away from the message boards. It's a shame too because they are almost trying to be facebook like with friends comments newsfeed. But there are a lot of mean and unhappy people on there. I lost 3 pounds my first week so I'm encouraged to stick with this app.
1007, I've purchased a number of curling irons over the years, at various prices. The Conair Satin Finish 1-Inch Ceramic Curling Iron is a tremendous bargain. The ceramic finish allows me to put some strategic curl in my hair after blowing dry, without having my hair be damaged by sticking to the surface and overheating. The clamp holds securely enough to work on thin sections without slipping.This iron offers great convenience of use, safety features, and even imparts a wonderful shine to your hair. You can pay more for an iron, but it will be hard to match all these features at this great price, and I will definitely buy a second one in a different size.
1008, I wore these shorts when I was a cheerleader and I always loved them. Now that I am older I wanted something that had a similar fit and that were easy to workout in. I was scared that they would be too short or make me look ridiculous, but that wasn't the case. They fit me just as well as they use to, and if you order them in your correct size they look just like any other pair of athletic shorts. What I like most about these is that I can workout and my body and move loosely without the shorts sticking to my leg.
1009, Entering the food is difficult as it requires a lot of searching to finally find the food that matches what one has eaten - or is about to eat.  Also, the Tracker does not allow me to enter my weight lifting results.  It has the exercises, including the reps, amount of weight, number of sets, but after the form gets filled out it lists each exercise but the calories are not counted.  It is just an entry without a result.  Oddly, it does list and count the results of carido exercises.  Frustrating.So I stopped using it.AD2
1010, We purchased these straps for four bookshelves lined up on a wall just a bit longer than the shelves. I'm sure if we had been installing one piece of furniture, moving it to the left or the right to attach two straps to the studs (or each shelf had been significantly wider) there wouldn't have been any problem, but for our setup it didn't work. The only thing that worked for our shelves was centering each in front of one stud and hooking one strap to the back. Unfortunately, I couldn't find any other options that didn't involve using a stud (I anticipated this problem). These looked like the best and sturdiest option while also remaining slightly flexible. We have had them attached to the wall for about a week now and they seem as though they'll do the job!
1011, The premise of this program is simplistic and the writers don't do much with it.  A bunch of cops are given a few fragmentary, confusing clues about a crime, or something, in advance, and they have to figure out what the clues mean and stop the bad thing from happening.  Only instead of getting these clues from a medium or a psychic of some kind, these images get downloaded mysteriously from outer space.  The writer's don't do much of anything interesting with this idea.The characters are also poorly developed. The dialogue is mediocre at best. Bad British writers love to have their characters yell and scream and browbeat and insult each other and behave like incredibly annoying jerks.  There is a fair amount of that in this series.I had high hopes initially and looked forward to watching the episodes I bought. But after wading through four episodes, I am not at all surprised that the series was canceled after only 5 episodes. I would have canceled it myself.
1012, I love this hair towel.  It seems silly to have a towel specifically for your hair, but this thing allows me to dry my hair in a nice tight package.  And it definitely pulls more water from my hair than a traditional towel.  I'm buying a couple more for traveling, my gym bag, etc.Regarding the people who complain about the fit, I wonder if twisting it more or less would adjust the fit for your... more twisting and it's going to be tighter, less twisting and it's going to be looser.
1013, And yet...unlike anything I've ever heard before.  While this may be the antithesis of easy listening, somehow it seems there's a master to all this rage and noise.  While I wouldn't call this party music or listen to this every day, it's easy to see that Surfer Rosa by the Pixies would not exist with this album and Atomizer (Especially "Something Against You", which after hearing the two albums almost seems like a Big Black impersonation).  And for that influence alone, I have to admit this "music" (I have to use the word loosely here) isn't half bad.
1014, I've been using this serum for years. It does what it claims: regenerates my skin! I first got to know it via a sample I received. As soon as I put the serum on my face, my skin instantly felt soft and smooth. After a few days of use, my skin continued to stay soft and smooth. When my sample was used up, I noticed my skin became not that smooth again, so I knew it was this serum that did the magic. Then I went to purchase this serum ASAP. I don't have sensitive skin, but I prefer the fragrance free one since I believe less fragrance, less irritation. I've been using it every night before bed, and never stop using it ever since! Sometimes I use it on my body skin, i.e. hands, elbows and knees, to keep them soft as well. The product has done a great job keeping up its quality over the years. Highly recommended!
1015, I've used other external chargers, and the iTorch is much more compact and fits well in the hand. The battery also holds more charge. Overall, it's quite easy to use, with standard USB and micro USB adapters (no proprietary plugs which is a good thing). There is no AC adapter, but I have plenty of those so didn't find that to be a major drawback.The LED light is useful to gauge how much charge is left. The laser pointer is a fun toy, although I didn't find much practical use for it and the flashlight is not bright enough to use for anything other than a tiny bit of light in a pinch (similar in intensity to the backlight of your phone).The one drawback is that there's only one USB slot so you can only charge one phone at a time, but apparently this was intentional to extend the battery life. Overall, a solid battery and one that I'd buy again.
1016, I really love the part of this mount that holds my iPhone. It has adjustable friction (ball and socket) that makes it easy to rotate into landscape format and back. The clamp opens and closes easily and holds the phone securely - even with the phone in a case. The opening at the bottom allows you to easily connect a car charger. The stiff goose neck allows you to place the phone just where you want it.Unfortunately, the suction cup is too small and too stiff to support the weight of the phone. I tried a number of different mounting locations on the windshield and tried using the adapter to attach it to the dash, but it would always fall off - usually very quickly.Now that I've attached the suction cup to the dashboard with silicon sealant, I'm pretty happy with this solution. Unfortunately, it's literally stuck there until I decide to remove it permanently.
1017, It took guts for Sting to walk away from The Police at the height of their popularity to create a rock band of jazz musicians. This fact is not lost when you see Synchronicity Concert.The huge, mullet-headed audience at The Omni in Atlanta was somewhat intert but still enthusiastic. While there are a few crowd reaction shots, they don't interfere with the visual experience.The only flaws I can find are that the camerawork is stiff and amaturish at times and Spirits In The Material World is too annoying to watch.Overall, this is the best (only?) document of the end of The Police.[DW]
1018, This is by far the best collection of Devo videos, bar none.  It blows the DVD "Devo - The Complete Truth About De-Evolution" completely away.  This video compilation has great segue sequences between each music video that creates a really entertaining production.  There are vignettes in here that you can't find in other collections of Devo vids - appearances by Booji Boy and many other great Devo characters.  I don't understand why this VHS tape hasn't simply been re-issued in DVD format.  I'd buy it in a heartbeat.
1019, Seeing that I have watched quite a few of the earlier seasons I have to say that Season 7 by far was better than Season 6, but also stands out to me, as one of the better Seasons overall. With strong writing that leaves you wanting more, this to me is the hallmark of a good Season. The writers in the series challenge the status quo and put forth some topics that would be taboo in other television series'. I applaud them for taking this stand and doing something different than has been done before and what the viewer gets in return is a great series that sometimes can be seen as a bit off color at times, but overall funny and definitely entertaining. I highly recommend this season and this series to all!
1020, Easy to use, easy to install and it has so many different options of installation (extensions, y-spindles, stairway adaptors) and all were easy to figure out. Even my 60 plus mother said it was easy to figure out how to use it without any instruction. Really liked how the bottom "supports" that press against the wall were flat on the bottom edge so they lay against the floor better. My other brand of gate didnt have that. Only complaint was my box had no directions in it. But managed without them.
1021, Audio Fidelity does not use the Original master tapes on this and about all of the CD releases.  They claim the sources they use are going to give the consumer a great sounding CD.If you're not using the Original master tape then you're comparing HDTV to analog TV.This version sounds very slightly better then the Motown release but compare the cost.I wish Mobile Fidleity would release this because they use nothing but the Original Master tape and the sound comes through.A great Stevie Wonder CD, but all of his CD's are great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1022, Oh what a great novel this is.  Clancy weaves a tale that is believable and complex, seemingly having thought of every detail.  We get to see a character that is thoroughly engaging, despite the fact that the book touches on such a touchy subject as condoning murder.  As reprehensible as it sounds Clancy is able to make you agree with him.The book could at times get pretty graphic but I don't think it is gratuitous.  Instead, the detail allows you to feel and see what is happening, as well as let you into Clark's world.I have nothing bad to say about this book, only good.  I would definitely recommend Without Remorse to everyone.5 stars.
1023, First and foremost, this was an early attempt to make opera into a film that is not a recording of a production.  I found it a very painless introduction to an opera I only knew from its ballet music.  Though it is lipsynched, have no problem with that, and it made go look for the history of the mysterious (and extinct) Potlovesian culture.  I also  just purchased the complete opera (with Borodina).  All I can say is that I enjoyed it immensely.  The actin g is excellent, as well as the singing.  The one flaw: it's a barebones Kultur disc.  But it has subtitles, so you do not need a libretto.
1024, first off, the rating is 1-star only because i can't leave it at 0. i got this phone over the iphone because of the lack of MMS and QWERTY keypad on the iphone. boy, that was a HUGE mistake. when i initially bought the phone, i had it for only a week and a half when major bugs started showing up. the keypad text only shows up half of the time and it was taking literally 10 minutes to open programs. no joke. then, it started freezing so badly that the only way to shut it off was to remove the battery. during this time frame, i had not downloaded anything that could have disrupted the phone in any way. needless to say, i returned this phone and got a replacement.the replacement phone was great...for a month and a half. that's when all the issues from the first phone started happening again. with this phone, i refrained from downloading anything, period. all i can say is that this phone sucks big-time.
1025, The material and craftsmanship while poor, performs adequately well and is of a more than reasonable price. With a generic strap, cheap split ring and cap, much to my surprise that the lobster clasps just by themselves are worth the price. I recently just bought 10 lobster clasps for $4-ish and were of terrible quality. Just pulling on the lever would risk breaking the entire thing. For half the price, I got much better set of clasps as well as the bonus of the straps I needed.Going by the picture and description, I did not expect these clasps to come-with, so I'm not only satisfied, but just very may buy another 10.I used the straps to string charms to my PSP and 3DS.
1026, I am very happy with this hair wrap. I don't know if it actually reduces my hair drying time. I just like the way it stays on my head so tight. I can get so much more done with wet hair than ever before. I can run up and down the stairs to the laundry room, brush my teeth, put on my makeup, drink my coffee. Could not do that with a regular towel wrapped around my head, that is for sure. I squirt some of my leave in conditioner into my hair before I wrap it (if I remember) and I like the way it feels when I finally take off the wrap. I might have to make this my standard girlfriend gift this holiday season.
1027, My granddaughter is eating baby food now, but for the more runny foods, I find it much easier to mix the food with formula & give it to her in a bottle.  I also mix cereal and feed it this way, especially first thing in the morning, when she is impatient to eat.  I had a difficult time cutting holes in the regular nipples to allow proper flow of this mixture.  It ended up flowing either too fast or not fast enough.  This nipple works great, because as she is nursing, I can simply turn the bottle to the best spot for the perfect flow.  What a great idea!  Happy baby makes Grandma happy!
1028, I never thought I would give 5 stars to something that tastes so nasty, but it works.I bit my nails for years and years, but finally kicked the habit when I became a nurse and realized how disgusting a person's hands can be. Unfortunately, I have been stressed lately and started biting again. It's such a gross habit, and I knew I had to quit again. But I just couldn't.In stepped Mavala. It is so disturbingly gross that I have to be careful even when eating things with my fingers to ensure I don't accidentally get any in my mouth. You do get *slightly* used to the taste, but not enough to allow you to want to purposefully put your fingers in your mouth.Works on pets, too! lol. My brother's dogs kept chewing on a corner of a hammock stand. I slathered the stuff on it and the chewing stopped right away. Just a thought.
1029, I have read all 5 books in this series and am really looking forward to the release of the sixth book. I have thoroughly enjoyed them all. If the series was written at a &#34;PG13&#34; level instead of an &#34;R&#34; level, I would have given it five stars. I would not be comfortable sharing this with anyone under 17 or 18 years old, which is unfortunate because it is such an engrossing storyline.  It is easy to see why this is a best selling series. If you aren't concerned with the &#34;R&#34; level writing, you will probably consider this a 5-star book series.  Enjoy.
1030, We use 3 different battery tenders on our ATV's and mobility chair. None are in the same place, and we need the option of different length cords so we can park them where we want and no right next to an electrical outlet. Even with the extension cords these have performed flawlessly--one of them for over 3 years now. We used to go through ATV batteries about every 2 years--by keeping the batteries charged with these devices, they are lasting at least 4 years so far (keeping our fingers crossed).  These things are running 24/7 and we've never had a problem.
1031, First of all, I really like these headphones.  Having a remote and mic is now a requirement for all headphones I buy - and these meet the that bar.  They sound great, a bit bass heavy, but that is fine.  For the price ($20), they are an excellent value.  Now the downside - they are not durable.  Every six months or so, they stop working.  I send them back to Maximo and they send me a new pair.  I guess you get what you pay for - but I wish they lasted a bit longer.  If you are willing to go through the hassle, Maximo's customer support is great.
1032, I really hated this game it oz a waste of memory and Iwill never get a game created by this company again. Irecommend NOT toget this app. I was entirely dissatisfied with app. All you do is jump the same old obsticle. What ever you do DO NOT GET THIS APP.BORRING!!!!!A WASTE OF SPACE!!!! WHO EVER MADE THIS GAME WAS A DUMMY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1033, I had my doubts when I bought these earrings.  I've not had much luck in buying jewelry on line.  I was always disappointed with my purchases--cheap, tinny and badly made.  So when I opened the little velvet bag they came in and pulled them out, I was amazed at the brilliance of the stones and the delicacy and quality of the silver settings.  I will buy another pair as a holiday gift.  No disappointments here . . . I have already worn them several times.
1034, While Stevie's Albums at Best since this One have been Up&amp;Down this one was Very Complete.The Music&amp;Lyrics are Solid From Start To Finish.All I Do With Michael Jackson is a Gem.Rocket Love is Great.Betty  Wright,The O'Jays,The Gap Band all Sound Great.Happy Birthday is a Great  Tribute To Dr.Martin Luther King JR.Jodeci did a Remake of Lately a few  years back.Master Blaster(Jammin) a Great Tribute To Bob Marley.Fantastic  from The Genius Mind Of Stevie Wonder.
1035, I really enjoyed the DVD because it is a Russian folk story that features one of the greatest ballerinas ever.  I greatly admire Maya Plisetskaya's technical and performance abilities and I especially enjoyed seeing her execute the fouette turns with the corps de ballet towards the middle of the DVD.  The film was a bit fuzzy, but the story and music were a joy.  I recommend this for children, especially children studying classical ballet because it shows us that ballet does not have to be stiff, sterile or acrobatic to entertain, as is so often the case now.
1036, Wow, this tv series on sci-fi is amazing! Love it, love it, love it! I ordered the third season on "instant video" because I was so anxious to continue watching it and couldn't wait but I will be sure to purchase all complete seasons on dvd. And I hope that there are many seasons to come. Excellent story plots, fantastic performance from cast, and amazing effects in addition to the scenery...Haven is a beautiful place even if these supernatural events keep happening...the panorama for all the scenes is breathtaking!
1037, This is a great concept, and everything is good about it compared to a wired headset, except two things.First, there is a very little bit of static or fizzing sound in the background of listening to music with it from my Smartphone. And second, much less important to most except those like me, it doesn't capture the ultra-low frequency bass sounds that I like to hear. It has very good low bass and overall range from highs to lows. Understand the difference between low range bass and ultra-low range bass.I don't know if the slight hissing sound was due to the Smartphone or the speakers of the headset, but otherwise it's excellent.
1038, I love the diversity of tech news you can find in one place. I was a bit bummed when I realized it was a clearing house so to speak of all the major tech news websites. That it actually just links you to all the popular tech websites. But really What an ingenious idea. I never knew a lot of these sites were out there. You don't have to go to each website and get all the current stuff this app does it for you. I'd fully recommend this app for anyone who wants to stay current on your tech stuff.
1039, I love you Teena..OH MY GOD!! This album is incredible..Although there are only 8 tracks, this music is timeless and any Teena Marie fan should have it..She starts off the album by making her listeners shake their thing on the dance floor but when you get to track #7, you realize why she is so loved..Her voice on Tune in Tomorrow..I cant even explain..She can hold a note till forever, and when she scats, you cant help but be in awe of her powerful voice..This woman has such a passionate voice that all I can say is, Get the album now!!!
1040, So many of my favorite characters die off or disappear on this series.  Only two of the original cast remain by the end of the series.  It's an intriguing series, novel, but basically same plot for each episode which eventually culminates in one master plot line of saving the world by collapsing universes.  The &#34;monsters&#34; all seem cast of the same mold and this is where innovation and imagination could have catapulted the series.  If you want something of the same ilk with more innovation and sophistication, try FRINGE--the whole series.  You won't be disappointed.
1041, The tops of my hands suffer with multiple hand washings per day. They get so dry that they crack over the knuckles and none of the creams my dermatologist suggested helped much.  They were thick and oily, but they didn't seem to penetrate deeply enough to help. They simply rubbed off and my chapped knuckles were just as dry underneath.Udderly smooth penetrates really well. It penetrates fully in just a few seconds, even when you apply a thick layer. It dries to a silky finish rather than a greasy one or a silicone-coated sticky feeling (like "Working Hands" does).The only thing I don't like is the fragrance, which is like baby powder, but fairly strong. It would be better unscented, for sure. When I want fragrance, I use my perfume - and I prefer my lotion not to interfere with the scent.
1042, bought a pair of these (price listed is per individual wiper) for my wife's 2004 Audi A4.  I had earlier purchased a pair of Silblade wiper blades, but found their plastic adapter a poor, weak fit to the Audi's wiper arm.  These Valeo's fit, with a slide locking attachment exactly like OEM.  It will NOT fly off your arm (unlike the Silblades...see my review on those).  I can't comment on longevity, but my wife says they do a great job--quiet and competent...
1043, The best non-toxic products by far, the honeysuckle fragrance is not available in the stores, it minimizes the chore of doing dishes.  My husband enjoys washing the dishes, because he likes the smell.  We're in the process of demolishing our kitchen, so a dishwasher won't be installed soon enough, but this liquid dish soap cleans, cuts grease, foams well with small drops, plus gives aromatherapy in the kitchen.  Meyer's cost more, but the concentrated product goes a very long way, great value.
1044, These things will do, if your tires are OK with hard plastic hugging. My tires are not talking to me because they want something cuddly.Well, it does do the job of keeping your car from rolling, but I am not too happy with them. Because of the shape of these huggers, they get stuck under the tires after jacking up your car. You have to move your car in the opposite direction to remove them. Another thing I did not like is the build of these things. Though they look sufficiently durable, it feels kinda brittle, especially when the tires rest on it and you hear the about-to-crack sound. I used this with a light vehicle.Verdict: I kinda recommend it, given a relatively cheap price.
1045, I was just reading a High end European car forum. Discussed was how you have to use Meguires or Mothers Gold,clay, etc. Many were insisting that you had to spend some big money and get it right. That couldn't be further from the truth. Nu-Finish works and really will protect your paint and is a fraction of cost of other designer waxes. Nu-Finish IS NOT A WAX, it's a POLISH. Why wax a clear coat anyway? Waxing a clearcoat is dumber than a bag of hammers.Nu-Finish will not harm a clearcoat,absolutely will not. It shines as good as any car wax and lasts a long,long time. This stuff works. If it didn't it would not have lasted so long. Look at the high ratings. Screw those expensive designer waxes that last about a week, get some Nu-Finish, the professional detailers secret!
1046, This book has been a huge disappointment.  I keep reading it hoping a real story will develop.  Yes, the science of terraforming Mars is intriguing, but all too simplistic in Robinson's account.  The characters are paper thin and for the most part ANNOYING.  The only real character is conveniently disposed of just as an actual plot was developing.  The only reason I will finish this is is out of a hope that Frank, Maya, Hiroko and the rest of the annoying lot will somehow meet a cruel and painful death at the hands of Ray Bradbury and Edgar Rice Burroughs at the end.  If you want a classic about Mars, go read Bradbury's &quot;Martian Chronicles.&quot;
1047, I received my Motorola H710 today.  I was able to pair it, charge it and use it without using the instructions, it is that easy to use.  From what I can see, the sound is superb.  It connects immediately when you open the boom.  I had a Motorola H500 previously and had nothing but problems.  I highly recommend this model.  From the reviews I have read it offers superior wind noise reduction also.  Can't wait for summer to open my sunroof and give it a try!!
1048, We didn't buy this seat until our daughter was 4 months old, because we were previously using the Puj tub. I only wish we had bought it sooner! I love the fact that it is non-toxic plastic, made in the USA, and can be used for many months. One side has a cradle seat for younger babies, and the other side has a round piece that keeps older babies who can sit up from slipping and falling. Right now our daughter is using the cradle piece, and loves that she can splash around. When she can sit up, we will put her on the other side. We will feel much safer putting her in this knowing that she won't be able to slip like she would in the regular bathtub. One of our best baby purchases!
1049, I am a die-hard science fiction fan and this trilogy is what I usually like -- plausible science, fully developed characters. However, the pace is not just slow, it barely moves at all, and the plot gets lost along the way. This is the third time I have tried to read it, and I still couldn't finish -- too boring. There are long, long monologs on the science, and tensions in relationships that keep you hoping for some fireworks that in many cases never materialize.These are the most boring personalities that I have seen in fiction in a long time. The story never really engages you. Spend your time reading something else.
1050, Do sad they stopped production at 2 seasons.  The producers had finally taken the corny and juvenile schlock our of the Star Gate franchise and given us an Adult Show with complex chatacters and then...  And then...  Some doofus pulled the plug!  So sad!  My wife and I really enjoyed binge streaming Sg-U for the second time.  Very enjoyable characters and story line - though rescuing Chloe gets tedious!!!  The other characters remained engaging.  Sorry it ended so abruptly!
1051, I used this to remove adhesive left on my hood after removing the clear vinyl paint protector that was worn out and looked like s***. It works ok to remove adhesive, but it's not the kind of thing where you just apply it and it comes off easily. It still takes a lot of rubbing and scrubbing. It's better than nothing, but it's also not that great.A few things to note about this product:1. It evaporates really quickly, so make sure you use it in a cool place, away from direct sunlight. Otherwise it will just evaporate really quickly and do nothing.2. It will haze up plastics, I accidentally got some on my head lights and side mirrors and it damaged the finish. I was able to correct the damage, but just be mindful of this.
1052, I am writing this soon after returning from the Metropolitan Opera House where I was subjected to the Willy Decker version of this classic work.  Decker's was an all white set, a big clock, and essentially all four acts in the same space.  Wonderful performers (Natalie Dessay, Dmitri Hovorostovsky, and Matthew Polenzani) shackled to an unimmaginative production which in the last act distorts the meaning of what Verdi intended (my opinion).  When I got home I put on this DVD and immediately the stench of modern staging was erased as it took me back to a time when there were sets and costumes that reinforced the underlying meaning of a work.  I agree that this DVD has technical deficiencies but the fluidity of the performances, the beauty of the set, and the incredible acting of Anna Moffo, overcomes, in my mind, these deficiencies.  The Moffo version of this opera, directed by Mario Lanfranchi is beautiful and well worth watching just to see what can be done when sung well and interpreted properly.
1053, Ever wonder what Samus did before the world was infested with tentacle monsters for her to go around blasting? Well this is it. You can watch the early days of Sam as she sports her blond boy cut and bandaged blaster arm as she travels through Mexico with a man that apparently graduated from the Nicholas Cage acting school. Yes, this is the movie we have all been waiting for Metroid fans! I cannot wait for the sequal when Sam finally puts her Gold and Red suit on and takes flight into space to find Mother Brain. Yes! This is the film of the year. Metroid the Other M(Montsters) the movie.
1054, Although the Jack Ryan fans are used to the books building on one another, this one features a side character. This book can be read by anyone who feels that books just can't do it for them. I have lent this book to three or four others, and the ones who actually read it loved it! It's a great book!You do not have to know about Clancy's previous books to enjoy this one; that alone makes it a good selection in some cases. I would think that this book would be enjoyed by anyone who likes action movies.
1055, This is for competists who have listened to all the other Christie audiobooks and audio plays. You get a Parker Pyne, a couple of Harley Quins, one Poirot, and other assorted non-series stories. Please note that this collection is not read by Hugh(Capt. Hastings) Frazier, like most other collections are. And the actor used is not as good as Frazier, at least to my ear. I came here specifically that my library copy seems to cut out at the end of one story (Next to a Dog). The end of the story is pretty obvious, but I'm quite sure that something is  missing. I'm surprised that no one else has mentioned it.If possible, I would stick to the BBC Audiobook series - they may have these same stories within their collections.
1056, UPDATE: Upon deleting the app, it still left several MB on my SD drive that I had to manually remove using AndroXplorer.This app was neck and neck with Seesmic, so I had to get picky.1.I don't like it when apps ask for access to my data. Seesmic asks for fine GPS data but does not seem to access the low level system logs that Tweetcaster sees, according to the product description.2. I do like the dark grey theme of Tweetcaster, its ZipIt feature, list creation within the app, and the choice of URL action. Also, it is easier to tell if something's been retweeted in Tweetcaster and by whom, as long as you recognize the RT'er's logo.As others have noted, you can post to FB but not read others' posts. I keep hoping Tweetdeck desktop's features will be replicated in this app, too.
1057, I just got these in brown and black. The size 5.5 is perfect for me, so these are true to size and have a little give in the toes. They look great with skirts (wearing the brown ones with tights now) and with jeans. They slip on so easily I'll wear them everywhere. I would give 5 stars, but the sides wrinkle as I walk. No biggie, just not as sleek-looking on the sides as I walk. But I'm probably the only one who notices that.Oh, the leather is soft; these were comfortable right out of the box. Not sure they'll last more than 2 years, but they're reasonably priced, look good, feel good, so I'm okay with that.
1058, my favorite song on here is "higher ground," but everything else defied all of my expectations for how Motown records are supposed to sound.  Easily Stevie's best cd, and his most consistent (songs in the key of life is supposed to be good to, but it has more filler tracks), there is no filler in this cd.  everything on here just blows my mind, I can't believe that everything is so good.  I was honestly expecting schmaltz, because that is what I associated Wonder with before.  This destroyed all those preconceptions.  One of the greatest albums ever made, and the perfect place to begin.  I am astonished that a blind man could make such astounding music.  We all have something to learn.  go get it now!!!
1059, We gave our baby his first bath in this when he was only 5 days old, and we're still loving it now that he's almost 5 months. It's growing well with him and he always seems secure so that we don't worry about him slipping around. It is a large tub (almost as long and wide as our standard bath), so I don't recommend it if you are looking for something easy to store. However, if you have a dedicated child's bathroom where you can keep it, then this is a great baby bath tub.
1060, I was looking for a diaper organizer/caddy for my changing station. I have an Ikea baby changing station and I needed an organizer that would hang from it, because I can't velcro something through it. That is exactly why I bought this diaper depot and I love it! Do pay attention to how wide your changing station's side is, it needs to be equal to or less than ~1.25 inches; otherwise, this diaper depot won't fit.I am able to fit some diapers in the middle compartment, place my wipes on top, and keep a few handy things in the side compartments. This allows me to use the entire space of the changing pad for my baby. Otherwise, I'd use some of the space to keep my wipes and diaper on the pad while I'm changing my baby. As she's growing, I need to be able to use the entire space for her and diaper depot helps me do just that. Love it.
1061, I've been buying and trying different blutetooth stereo headsets supporting the A2DP profile, in search of the perfect one.  The form factor on this one is just about the best.  The dogtag chain relieves strain from the earbuds and can be hidden discreetly under your shirt.  The earbuds are designed to loop behind your neck, which is at first a bit odd, but makes a lot of sense.  The headset profile sounds pretty good and the A2DP profile is good but not excellent-- the bass is rather weak.  I pair with the Sony TMR-BT8iP on my iphone to connect to the A2DP profile.In contrast, I also have the Sony DRBT21G/B headset -- the sound there is richer but it is bulky and dorky looking when going to the gym.Overall, I'm quite pleased with this item but only give it 4 stars because the stereo sound could be better.
1062, I really like these songs, but they seem a little contrived and not "important" (best description I think) because they are just so focused on being soulful that they kind of miss the mark.  I have found that a lot of popular music seems to do this, and Marvin Gaye is leagues ahead of those people, but honestly I was a little dissappointed after I was done listening.  Al Green's music seems much better to me, I got both cd's at the same time.  I would still recommend this cd, if you have heard songs like "lets get it on" or whatever and you REALLY like them.  contrived sappy singing and little bitty complaints just don't do it for me in music, and I felt that many songs were like this on the set.  I still enjoy it, but not that much.  Al Green's greatest hits is a much better choice for a new fan expanding into the genre.  Also Otis Redding.
1063, We have two of these gates that we use to contain the babies (15 mo. and 4 mo.) IN the living room and to keep the dog OUT of the living room.  Easily installed and adjustable.  We haven't had to use any extensions.  15 mo. old can't open it but 6 yr. old nephew can operate it easily on his own.  We are buying a third one of these to keep the 15 mo. old out of the laundry room.  They are WONDERFUL!
1064, Apparently they never told the writers that there was not going to be a second season so they ended the program with a whole lot of unanswered questions which would have been answered had there been a second season. The network killed this show by starting it on a certain night in a certain time slot then give it a three week break and when they restarted it they put it on a different night in a different time slot and then justify cancelling the program due to its small viewing audience even though it had a fairly large viewing audience originally.
1065, Lots of alien movies come out every year.  Some are the typical alien invasion - war movies along the lines of Independence Day and War of the Worlds.  Then there are the horrific people-getting-eaten movies like The Blob.  Occasionally there is the aliens stranded on Earth movie like ET, Starman and District 9.  Now we have a rarity; a movie about a space probe that accidentally brins back alien life, which proceeds to spread throughout the US-Mexican border.  None of the life is humanoid, and they don't seem to want to eat humans.  The movie plot is about a man and woman traveling thru alien colonized land, trying to find their way out.  Their are occasional alien encounters, and they look realistic enough.  The aliens themselves are quite unique; octopus like animals that can emit light in patterns as a form of communication.  Shot on a very low budget, this movie is quite engaging and original and I enjoyed it.
1066, Installed this yesterday. It is a great low tech solution to placing vehicle at exactly the same place every time. I looked at several other options using radio frequencies and lasers. Decided on this option, nothing to go wrong.Others complained of movement of the parking mat. I have not had this installed long enough to evaluate performance concerning slippage. I did carefully clean the area with a powerful solvent before installation as garage floors are likely to have an oily coating. I will update this posting later as necessary.2/17/14I have epoxy paint on my garage floor which could result in the sticky stuff not working. After carefully cleaning the area with a good solvent the mat has not moved. I even hit the rear stop hard to see if it would move. The wife loves it. Highly recommended if installed properly.3/16/14Still exactly where I put it without using any thing other than the supplied double stick tape. Cleaning the installation area carefully is critical. I used lacquer thinner.
1067, I agree with the other reviewer that this book had me completely spellbound.I'm about half way through the flashman series and so far I've enjoyed them all however this one as far as I'm concerned is easily the best that I've read.As everyone knows there is probably no event in American History that has been more warped by historians and wannabe historians then the events that transpired in relation to the various Native American tribes.Unlike just about everyone else Frazier through the mind of Flashman weeds through all the crap and tells it how it really was with all the typical Flashman flair that I've come to expect.His creation is pure brilliance, after reading this book I literally walked down to the local bookstore and bought a couple westerns, including the biography of Wooten that Frazier himself recommends.This book may of just hooked me on the western genre.
1068, The IMP52D took 105 minutes to fully charge of my iphone 4 from 34%. It costs half of the charger power(2 LED lights out of 4 were off). I would suggest that the battery pack should contain its own wall charger. The charger can charge iphone 4 two times only. As far as I know, iPhone 4 battery capacity is 1420mah so the itorch could charge the cell 3 times. So I would suggest to improve the battery power on this version. But overall, I like it and I will rate (4), if it could charge more times, I would rate it (5) stars.
1069, Major Peter Petersen is sent to deliver a message in Alistair MacLean's PARTISANS, but suspicion is the vital element that insures survival in the deadly game of espionage during any war. The questions is who is being set-up and for what reason, but then who is connect to whom by what ties.MacLean delivers an excellent adventure where Petersen is never sure until the last chapter who he can trust and who has more than life at stake.A good read at any time.Nash Black, author of QUALIFYING LAPS.
1070, Never will forget Diana Ross coming through completely mesmerized audience that wonderful night in 1976 at Los Angeles Music Center Ahmanson Theater during "Reach Out And Touch (Somebody's Hand)", luckily having close front isle seat she touched mine...teen fan from early "Supremes" beginning, this wondrous experience was unforgettable! Diana glowed & shimmered in gorgeous costumes by this time totally the grand Diva Superstar, fantastic arrangements armed with killer program of a great mix of songs, this fantastic re-mastering of what originally was a old vinyl double-record classic, be transformed back in time with one of the greatest performers of our time, Miss Diana Ross...lady you rock & this live recording is your legacy to be so proud of, for us lucky music lovers a magical musical treasure to be savored and enjoyed over and over!HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
1071, I have a new vehicle and of course, new tires.  After a week, the tires looked a bit dull, so I decided to try this product.  My tires were clean so I just sprayed the stuff on the rubber.  It's hard not to get overspray on you wheels, however, and you will need to clean them afterwards.  This stuff smells like bug spray, but with just one application, my tires looked great.  The letters on the tire looked 3D.  I didn't want to overdo the shine, so I stopped at just one application, but the manufacture says your can do a second application right after the first coat drys.  However, after a month I could't resist one more application.  I think the can will do four or more applications, which I plan to do from time to time.  Makes your tires look brand spanking new.  Add a nice wax job and you have a great looking vehicle.
1072, This book scratched an itch I've had for a long time: for a technical, well-imagined, and logically fleshed out (in short, &#34;hard&#34;) science fiction story. I learned a lot of cool things about the real world by reading this book. I didn't even know piezoelectricity existed before. Some of the hypothesized bits about the nature of Mars are very cool as well. I loved it all.The story is not nearly as strong as the science. Occasionally it's weird, occasionally it drags. However, there are also times when it shines very much on its own. Uneven would be the word for it, I suppose. Taken together (and provided you are reading this for some real science fiction!) I'd give the package four stars, and will definitely be reading the next book as well.
1073, As a friend referred to it, this album sounds &quot;raw, yet professional.&quot; The mysterious Kentucky quartet Slint is one of those bands that happened at just the right time and produced a stellar album that probably can't be duplicated. No other band has sounded like this before or since, although I find some parallels in the music on this album to some of the things done by Tool. Slint's use of dynamics was so far ahead of its time that bands and musicians are still trying to catch up. From the opening harmonics of &quot;Breadcrumb Trail&quot; to the closing explosive &quot;I miss you(s)&quot; of &quot;Good Morning, Captain,&quot; this album has to be heard. Julian McMahan's sung/spoken delivery of the lyrics seem to fit right into the mix perfectly, while Britt Walford's drumming is almost mathematical in its precision. A masterpiece.
1074, I'll be quick.  Good idea here, poor engineering.  When it works it's wonderful, but it hits snags way too often.  I upgraded software as per customer service, it didn't help much.GPS is great when it works, but too often fails.Bluetooth stereo is great when it works, but too often it fails and devices have to be reset/repaired.I have to reboot an average of 4 times per week.One solid plus, the cell signal has been outstanding for me.  I can get a connection and complete a call when my friends can't.If the next iPhone has GPS I will probably eBay my Tilt.
1075, I love this brand of shorts which is why I gave it 3 stars. However, I misunderstood the description and when I click on different links to the item, it changes from Juniors to Girls. I understood Juniors to mean teenage girl age. As a 20 year old girl, I can easily wear a M/L in these shorts for Juniors/adults. When I got my package, I received a Youth Large instead. I had to give the shorts to someone else who could wear them because I needed them on a time crunch. This is a good brand, just a little confusing on the description.
1076, I began using Fitness Pal to develop an eating plan for my husband when he developed diabetes and later had a heart attack.  It is a great app, it teaches a person how to eat healthy and live healthy using a food and exercise diary.  It is user friendly I know it affects change in a person's life because the proof is in the data collected throughout the weeks and used to help adjust your eating or exercise routine.  This is not a diet plan, it is a lifestyle coach.  My husband is a changed man mentally and physically.  He has learned about nutrition and exercise on this program and faithfully uses it daily.
1077, Love puzzles! I love Sudoku in paper format and thought I might like it in an app. I have to admit, I have not played it as much as I thought I would but that is only because there is so much to do when you get on your devices that there seems to never be enough time. I like this very much as I like soduku!!I really like the challenge at the beginning to middle levels. I have not played enough to get higher on paper format yet. So, I know app is going to take longer to get really good.
1078, I have just read the first two books of this trilogy. Magnificent and tiring, the books have great vision, but Robinson's reach sometimes exceeds his grasp. The Mars series is a brilliant imagining of a future world that manages to weave future science with contemporary problems in an interesting, ever thought provoking fashion. This compelling world is just about enough to offset Robinson's problems with dialogue, characters, pacing, and description. Despite the hamhandedness in all of the aforementioned, the world is vivid enough and the personalities compelling enough--at least the original, fully fleshed out ones, not their often hastily introduced replacements--that you'll likely be enraptured for quite a while. And while Green Mars sometimes put the sag into saga, there's not a doubt that I will slog through the last book.
1079, Sometimes you just have to look under the hood and fix things.  We've always been able to do this with Windows (and DOS before that), and it's necessary to be able to look in your file folders and tinker with things.  I was trying to download and install the Dolphin Browser for my Kindle Fire HD, but it would download and just disappear.  Thanks to ES File Explorer, I was able to find the download folder and run the install program.  No Sweat! I'm sure I'll find many other uses for it.  Thanks for the tool!
1080, True, this charger will charge multiple devices, but...1. Individual cables are not labeled as to what device they are for.2. The charger lights do not go out when the device is charged.  I can see how you might overcharge some devices because there is no automatic circuit that detects when the battery is fully charged.  Such "battery full" circuits are almost always present in chargers made for specific devices.3. Unless you buy an adapter specifically for the iPod, the USB adapter still requires an iPod charging cable, which you may already have.I'm not saying that the Chargepod doesn't do what it's supposed to do, but you should note these caveats.
1081, I have tried many products in the lip balm category, and most of them have let me down. As a male, I don't care for the usually disgusting fruity varieties. All I want is something that moisturizes, protects, and relieves my lips without being distracting. The Neutrogena Norwegian Forumula Lip Moisturizer does all of the above. It feels very smooth and thin and you forget that you have it on. The SPF 15 is essential for anti-aging too. I recommend buying this lip moisturizer if you want great results without the distractions of the other brands.
1082, Fantastic gate extremely easy to install.  There are no little places where kids can get their fingers pinched so I feel safe closing it even when my extremely curious and active 8 month old is crawling and climbing on it.  it's a tall gate so i don't worry about her going over it at all and it takes force to push the step down but easy to do.  Buy it for the entrance to hallways or in doorways where you want the door open sometimes but don't want babies in and out of that room.
1083, This small battery backup charger easily fits into the palm of my hand and is not bulky in my pocket. The itorch charged my iphone in what seemed like record time.My iPhone contained 2% battery life when I plugged in the iTorch and began charging. After 1 hour 50 minutes with my phone still turned on and in use, my iPhone5 received a full charge. Once I confirmed the full charge, I noticed the iTorch showed one solid blue LED and one blinking, indicating a remaining capacity of 35%. I still had enough to charge my Bluetooth headset.
1084, We have tried this product several times and found "IT DOES NOT DISSOLVE" as advertised. (Camco 2 Ply RV & Marine Toilet Tissue)It plugs up against the gate valve so when you open it to dump, the "solids" and the tissue cannot come through.We have had our Black Tank Line snaked twice due to this product plugging up against the drain line gate valve. (and yes we use the appropriate chemicals)"Do Not" use this product in your RV. Try "Thetford" brand. Although only single ply, it will not plug up your sewer line and it dissolves as advertised.
1085, I forced myself to sit through 5 episodes just to make sure that I wasn't mistaken in my feelings for this show.  The cinematography of the pilot was brilliant and was the main reason I gave the series more of my time than I ever should have, but even that paled quickly with the lackluster story line and turgid pace of the show.  Five episodes in and there is nothing, absolutely nothing going on, there is so little happening that it makes it hard to point to any one thing that stands out as a problem, it is just so blah that I can't see wasting anymore time on it than it took to write this.Summation, I completely understand why the show was cancelled and support that decision 100%.
1086, Kim Stanley Robinson's Mars trilogy, of which &quot;Red Mars&quot; is the first, is classic epic science fiction writing that is compelling and quite plausible.  Don't expect to get through it quickly, as the whole series  consists of nearly 2000 pages.  Those who like their SF writing fast and  action packed should look elsewhere.  Robinson's writing is literally  bursting with ideas and his descriptions of the political developments  among Martian colonists who as time goes by have less and less in commom  with the Earth the left behind rings absolutely true.  Warning, read  &quot;Red Mars&quot; only if you intend to complete the series for you'll  find yourself unable to avoid it.
1087, This series was originally suggested by a friend.  I found myself hooked after the first episode.  It's a totally unique premise about aliens invading our society and the repercusions associated with both 'good' and 'bad' alien influence.  The action and all around 'feel' of this series is excellent.  I appreciated the character development and interactions of the people starring in this series. I also appreciated the minimal special abilities of the aliens.  I find it to be very believeable.  Highly recommended series.
1088, I loved this app on my iPhone so I installed it for my Samsung Charge.  Firstly it hogs RAM and always runs in the background even if you kill it.  I didn't have an issue with photo quality as mentioned here but the banners that are on the screen block half of my album list.  It actually would generate errors on install originally. I had emailed the developer and he wrote back immediately.  We got it installed but the ram and running in the background issues were causing lag in the phone so I uninstalled it.
1089, OH MY GOD! This album, dang cd, is a must have! A classic and Stevie's best single album/cd. Every song stirs the emotions in some aspect. It showcases so many topics, poverty, love, hopelessness, hope, drugs, spirtuality -I could go on and on. Stevie, obviously, has put out some great music, but this collection of songs blends so well. Moreso than Talking Book and certainly Songs in the Key of Life. Though if stranded on a desert island, I would choose Songs in the Key of Life over this one, due to the many types of music and more songs. This is essential Wonder and as a true music lover, it would be in your best interest to have this one in your collection-no matter what your musical taste.
1090, I am somewhat of a windshield wiper snob.  I LOVE these. I've had many other brands of a similar style that has the internal metal structure only, including OEM Nissan wipers that are similar in style.This is the only brand that has two simultaneous capabilities:1.  Doesn't skid/make noise when there isn't enough water.2.  Uniformly wipes the window and doesn't seem to get "spots" where it doesn't wipeI am not a Rain X user, but I do use the Rain X wiper fluid.  I find the combination of that and these blades work very well together.
1091, In our part of the mid Atlantic, the last warm days of the year have brought out new swarms of brown marmorated stink bugs. Even though we try not to agitate them, efforts to redefine the boundary between human and insect space invariably result in the discharge of the odor that gives them their sobriquet.Clean Day is very effective at cutting the stink bug odor. Its own scent is pleasant without being overpowering.Liquid hand soap may be a commodity item, but your own peace of mind isn't. This is our go-to for eliminating the unfortunate outcomes of human-stink bug encounters!
1092, I've used these wipers now for around 2 months and they have held up through fall and winter weather without any major issues. As many other reviews note these wipers do miss a spot on the lower right passenger side but it is not a big issue. I did have a problem with my wiper popping off when I was lifting it and pushing it onto my windshield to break ice off of it. I was able to put it back on no problem but it made me a bit nervous it could happen again.
1093, We are blessed that this concert was caught on film. Every song is amazing, and both he and the wailers were on that night. My favorite songs on the set are &quot;Rebel Music&quot;, &quot;War - No More Trouble&quot;, and &quot;The Heathen&quot;. But even the other songs on this set are great. Beware because the version of &quot;The Heathen&quot; is amazing and you will rewind it many times to see it again.  I can't count how much i've played this in the year i've had it. Hopefully it comes out on DVD with bonus features.
1094, The size of this shirt definitely runs on the large side (loose fit). I usually wear a large and based on other reviews I ordered a medium; I am glad I did because the medium is a PERFECT fit for me. The shirt is very light weight, but very durable. It makes packing for a long trip a breeze, because you can pack more shirts and still not have a heavy suitcase. The pockets on the front are deep and perfect for people that have a lot of things to carry with them. I highly recommend this shirt.
1095, This debate just goes on and on...i don't know which is better. I have RP running in my transfer case and Amsoil in my tranny. Can i tell a difference? NOPE! They both seem to have great specs on paper with Amsoil has a slight edge on the viscosity around 100C degree, other than that, they are pretty much the same. Both are synthetic.  The only difference is RP is actually purple in color and you can get it off of Amazon. Amsoil, you have to buy direct.
1096, My sister got me this for my shower and I love it. I also own the ultimate wipes warmer and it clicks right into the top of this. It holds quite a bit of diapers for size 1 and I'm sure as they get bigger it won't hold as many. I love having this because it's right on the end of the changing table, has everything I need in it and is a life saver. I wish it could hold more stuff as some of the bottles of baby junk I got are a bit big. Other than that I love this product and wouldn't do without it. Great price too!
1097, SG-1 did 10 seasons. SG: Atlantis made it to 5 seasons and it was more of a continuation of the the SG-1 format! If they tried that again they would have been lucky getting anything more than the pilot.See the pattern here?The writers decided to make a bold move and do something radically different so they went ultra hardcore. And why not? The old format wasn't working anymore and the writing was on the wall, clear as day.How can you call yourself a true Stargate fan when you get a top-notch serious SG show, and you hate it. I dont get you haters. Perhaps you prefer the more popular nonsense on that damn channel like "Sharktopus vs. Gatoroid". Or do you prefer baby oiled men, in underwear, rubbing up against eachother. You haters disgust me and dont let me catch you in the street because you got lumps and bumbs comming! Frak you haters and frak the SyFy channel! Im done watching....
1098, I received a lovely pendant necklace several years ago, and wear it everywhere, but my long hair always tangles in the chain and trying to get the hair out usually breaks the chain.  I average buying about 4 new chains a year.  Since purchasing this chain, my hair is not tangled nor ripped out by the links, clothing fiber doesn't catch on it, my pendant does not get stuck on the clasp-in short, this is the worlds most perfect chain!  I cannot tell you how happy I am with this purchase!
1099, ...they're orange.I'm not so forgetful that I need a full blown checklist when I change my oil. I've never forgotten to replace the drain plug, or put in oil, etc. However, black tire chocks can sometimes do a good job of... uh... hiding themselves.Seeing the bright orange chocks serves as a reminder that you're not totally done yet.As far as durability goes, I have to agree with other reviewers here. If you're like me, and go all out to ensure you're doing things "the right way", they're fine. Would I trust them behind a small to medium sized car with a working parking brake? Sure. Would I trust them to keep a full size pickup with a bad emergency brake on ramps? Never.
1100, So I purchased because my Droid Charge eats batteries whenever I use it for anything long term, using the GPS it will last less than 30 minutes, sometimes on a walk I will want to pull up a map or use the pedometer feature to see how far I have gone, well then it just dies, now I can just stick the iTorch in my pocket and charge my phones 1600ma battery several times.The iTorch uses the same cable to charge it as i use to charge my phone so it is perfect for me.  The flashlight is really nice as it is pretty bright and being a LED it should last for hours the red led is useful if you have a cat or dog that will chase the light, the smalls pouch is a good size.Overall I am pretty impressed it is much better and last longer than the cheapo external batteries  and a much better value than the higher priced ones you can also find online.
1101, I recommend the large quilted multi-use pad in addition.  I have about 4 of them and they are essential.  I use John Lennon receiving blankets (6 is a good number) with an quilted absorbing pad underneath to be prepared for spills and smudges on my contoured changing pad. I do the same on his crib to save me the headache of changing crib sheets which are very tedious to get off and on. It's nearly impossible to do when you've had a c-section, and not a good idea to strain yourself.
1102, Someone described this before as the X files meets Twin Peaks, and they weren't wrong. But I think it may be even slightly better, as if those two shows weren't already wonderful.This is fresh and lightly done weirdness, with a picturesque town that seems almost normal, and yet just isn't quite. Full of characters, excellent twists on the mutant powers seen in X men and so many other works of fantasy, but described as troubles rather then gifts, mainly because whatever the new guy has got as his or her talent, just isn't under his control. And half the mystery of each show is simply trying to work out what power is at work and who has it, because they don't make it obvious early on.Best of all though, the ending. I won't give away any spoilers, but the twists were unexpected, not telegraphed in any way, and better yet, it doesn't explain all the mysteries. It saves that for season two.I can't wait.Cheers.
1103, purchased two in &#34;mocha&#34; and one in &#34;yam&#34;, all double XL, and the yam colored garment is at least two sizes smaller than the mocha colored garments (which fit perfectly) - the yam garment is also lighter weight. i noticed that the tags in the mocha garments show that they were made in thailand while the tag in the yam garment shows that it was made in china. i really dig the mocha garments, they are perfect in every way, but i would i would like to order other colors. unfortunately ordering other colors is problematic given there is clearly a difference between the garments depending on where they were made. can the seller indicate which colors were made where? this would be extremely helpful.
1104, it has enough room for about 15 diapers and a wipes container on the top.  The two side bins are removable (a little too easily if you ask me but no big deal) and we use them for small lotions, nail clippers, the nose aspirator, and a few other things.The large lotion bottle we have and the large &#34;tub&#34; of A+D ointment we use don't fit in this though so i have to keep those on the counter itself.This has a lip so you can hang it from the edge of the changing table but since we have rounded (sleigh style) edges, it doesn't fit there.  We ended up putting it on a drawer instead and it wroks just fine.  Only thing is that the drawer underneath the one we attached it to doesn't open (the diaper depot gets in the way since it's taller than the drawer).  No big deal.I would recommend this - it saves it space and keeps us organized.
1105, A great video showcasing the beginnings, musical journey, and transformation of the Moody Blues and their unique style of cosmic rock. Most of the original videos from their hit songs are included here.  The only glaring omission is their "Sitting At The Wheel" video from 1983's album "The Present", which I regard as one of their best.  Talking segments from all five members are included, and it's all edited together in one continous flow.  A complete look back at one of the best bands of all time...and it is a shame that at this writing they have yet to be inducted into the rock-and-roll hall of fame, an honor which they richly deserve, and for which they are LONG overdue.
1106, I used this diaper pail when I had my first daughter a couple of years ago and I did not like it at all. I thought it was very difficult to use. (until you get used to it)  It didn't contain the smell well at all. The refills were a pain to put in and like another reviewer said it twisted when it wanted to.  The lid also kept coming off of mine. I threw this out and bought the safety 1st odorless diaper pail which I find contains the odor much better.
1107, Both my husband and I wanted a navy blue sweatshirt but the colors were picked over after Xmas. Hanes had the navy in our sizes so we decided to try them out since my husband has worn the underwear with no problem. Well these have the strangest sizing imaginable. Body was too large yet short and the neck was so small you could barely get it over your head. If I'd only ordered one I'd have thought it was just that one but both sizes had the same issues. Buyer beware!!!!! Stick to their underwear.
1108, I started using this in combination with their night recovery cream. I couldn't be happier. I look at least five years younger and it has taken away that tired, drawn look.  My skin is softer and brighter.  My wrinkles are much less noticable. More importantly, as I have tried tons of products, it has reduced my under eye circles. This is no small feat. I have super dark blue, very hollow/sunken-in circles that, even with cover up, are still dark and shadowed because they are sunk in. This has plumped up the skin below my eyes, and, in addition to getting rid of much of the wrinkling, it has made it easier to put cover-up on the remaining discoloration, as it has taken away at least half of the sunken in look and the darkness. Really a big difference in only a week of using these products. I highly recommend this!
1109, My baby is breast fed and I needed to start pumping and bottle feeding before heading back to work after 12 wks of maternity leave. Baby would NOT take ANY nipple out there! We tried over 8 different nipples and bottle types. FINALLY this nipple worked! I believe most of it was my prayers asking the Lord to please help this baby take the bottle, but the nipple is the only one that he would take to! Also, amazon is one of the only places I've found that you can actually purchase this nipple! Great buy!
1110, I bought two pairs of 32x30 black, and both waists were a full 1 1/2 inches shy of 32" and no way I could get them to clasp. Sending both back. Also, I imagine you'd have to wash these like 20 times before they're comfortable. Super-coarse fabric. Durability's no good to me if I can't even stand wearing them long enough to beat 'em up a bit. I have a couple other pairs of Dickies (which are also sized a little funny, but not this badly) and suppose I'd try something else of theirs, but who knows...
1111, First. Let me tell you I travel and no. You can't plug your charger into a tree. That being said I love this thing. It charged my phone 3 times over all weekend. I had no problems with the size and having in my pocket next to my iPhone. The only thing I have to say i didt like is that It takes a long time to charge. But its a very big battery but it's ok cause thts what makes it awesome. If you travel or go through battery life a lot. This is def the product for you.
1112, accept no substitutes.our neo-soul superstars and wannabees mean well and i wish em well, fareal, but after you lissen to some pure-unadulterated-stevland you realize that all of these new jacks really are only honoring themselves with the music they make...imitation might be cute, but the best way to honor someone is to LISSEN TO THE SOUL THEY CRANKED OUT!!! lil stevie cant be outdone or even perfected upon... this cd is about as classic a soul album as you can get your hands on (this one and 'music-quarium'!)... even with the couple of 'atmospherically eclectic' material he presents here, it all still flows together...many musicians have vision, but it is the true artist that is able to manipulate sound to achieve it!(...you may now return to your previously scheduled program already in progress!...)
1113, Clich&eacute; after clich&eacute; after clich&eacute;, does not deliver. Not even randomly. The procedural is just so bad that it could have worked as a joke, but it instead tries to be too serious. The writing is painful Of the two main characters, she is as stiff, boring, and sanctimonious as the worst parody of a career woman attempts to be. He is a clown disguised as what I guess was meant to be a New York yuppie with suits and sneakers, bear, and hat. The love story is without chemistry. Naturally. The episodes plots are lame.
1114, So - We had one of the fancy schmancy Puj baths because of space concerns. The baby hated it.The baby loves this bath! He kicks and splashes and has a grand time. We place it next to the sink on the kitchen counter and it works wonderfully! My mommy group of over 80 women agree! This can be used for toddlers too as there is a sitting spot opposite of where the baby lays.We don't store it in the bathroom - it has a hole for a hook and we just hook it onto the back of the nursery closet door. (A tiny closet - but it fits!)This would be super useful for those without a bathtub and just a shower!
1115, I was extremely happy to get this watch.+ve1. Very elegant looking watch.2. You can set three timezones in this watch.3. The digital display can be turned off.4. The steel band looks awesome, and makes it a dress watch.5. The back light is good.6. This watch has a heavy rugged feel to it.7. The steel strap has a brushed look and feel.8. The seconds hand has RED color, which you would love.9. This looks exactly like the watch in stranger than fiction.This watch will never dissappoint you ever!-ve1. This watch is a little heavy on the wrist, you would always feel that you have this watchworn. Actually I kinda like heavy watches.
1116, So we had a little bit of an interesting situation. My husband and I were moving in to my parents' house after they built their house. We were preparing to live in the house about 1 year in advance, which is when I purchased this gate and installed it at my parents' house for when they had my daughter over there. It was barely used for the good part of that year, left open most of the time. Right before we moved in, my daughter ran into the gate (wasn't hurt, thank goodness) but it broke apart. Not only was the outside covered in plastic, the entire hinge was made of plastic! Are you kidding me? That much for a gate and you can't even give me a durable hinge? Sorry, but this was a waste of money!
1117, Director/Writer  J. Blakeson has constructed a simple kidnapping plan which goes seriously wrong and takes the viewer on a gripping journey of trust and betrayal.  You have already read the other reviews so I will not spoil the thrust of the plot.  Blakeson's film succeeds throughout with its excellent intertwining of its 3 actors and the brilliant editing by Mark Eckersley creating the atmosphere of a play within its cinemagraphic parameters. The relentlessly twisted plot will leave you breathless till the end credits. Gemma Arterton owns the film and hopefully we will be seeing more of her.  A gripping, exhausting enterprise by a filmmaker who has studied the masters.
1118, The GOOD:-No nasty smell/taste-Coverage lasts a long time-Excellent sun protection-SUPER moisturizingThe BAD:-Low melting pointLet me start by saying, this is the best chapstick I've ever used. Hands down. No questions asked. This stuff rocks!It applies very easily and smoothly. Unlike some others, it's not too thick, but also not too slimy. There is absolutely NO smell or taste, which is preferred by me. I used to apply chapstick about every 45 minutes, but this stuff keeps me covered for hours. It healed my chapped, sunburned lips in about 3 days and has kept them healthy for weeks. No more dry, cracked, chapped lips. The only bad thing is it seems to have a lower melting point than some of the more common chapsticks. It's never completely liquified on me, but if I leave it in the sun, or take it with me on a run it starts to get kinda squishy.Recommended: Absolutely
1119, Much better produced and a shining example of the uncharted (and, unfortunately, unnoticed) path to technicality-without-pomposity that Coronor was soon traveling, 1989's No More Color is a great stop-gap to the near-perfection of Mental Vortex.  "Die By My Hand" is a absolutely killer opener leading into a treasure trove of monster riffs that does not let up for the rest of the album. An essential thrash document from a band you've probably never heard of but most likely will never forget.
1120, I often use army duffles to travel and this one was just like the other army duffles I have. I got the biggest size in this and I wasn't able to fill it completely because it was so big and it got a very small hole in it on my first trip using it. I think it's probably because it was so huge and not completely full that it may have got caught in something. I would recommend getting the middle size (the largest size is really HUGE) for regular travel. If you plan on stuffing it with bedding then the huge size would probably be ok. I would definitely recommend this product. Reasonably priced and sturdy army duffle. The challenge is filling it up!
1121, These are great! Easy on, easy off... you can walk with confidence in the snow/ ice and they have had a workout this winter! I bought them for all my daughters and parents.  Even my little grandson wanted some, they are a bit too big for him this year but the extra small may fit him next year.  The sizes are deceiving, since I think a size 11 women's is large but it only takes a medium trak to fit the shoe well.  You can even wear them with heals because of the design.
1122, It took longer to take out of the package than to set it up with my phone.  Very easy, very intuitive - I barely looked at the instuctions.  Works great with my Sprint Touch phone, can skip back/ahead tracks, pause and take a call.  Love that I can use my own earbuds - I like to switch them out if I'm exercising so as not to mess up my good pair.Update - I used the 3030 for a while, and it always worked as it should.  I ended up not liking how long the earbud cords would be and that I still had an object around me that might as well have been my mp3 player/phone.  Since I typically keep my phone in my pocket, it wasn't that helpful for me to have the wireless distance from it.  Would be better for someone who keeps their phone in their purse or at the gym on the treadmill.
1123, I have many live CD's of Bob Marley, but this DVD has some of the best live versions of a lot of songs like "Crazy Baldhead", "The heathen", and "Exodus".Of course all the DVD is great but this 3 songs I want this versions on CD.I can't believe that there isn't a CD of this concert, but I looked all over Amazon and couldn't find any.Please somebody help me I am desesperate to have this songs on a CD.Thanks in advance and sorry for my bad english.If somebody can help me, my mail=ricpir@gmail.com
1124, To be honest, it's more of a 2.5 star book.  I honestly think the publisher told Martin - look, give us SOMETHING! We've got the HBO now, perfect tie-in yada yada.  Not his best effort.  Clunky and about 300 pages too long.  Please, don't just give us a bunch of pages edited into a "book".  I swear, if I hear, or read, the phrase "much, and more" or one of its permutations one more time, I will scream.  That phrase appears in the book approximately 8,999 times.  I am not sure when the next installment will come out.  Certainly I won't wait another 10 years.  At this point, I am not even sure I want to read it.
1125, I came across MFP on a parenting magazine and I checked it out. I signed up and havent left ever since. Its been almost 3 yrs and still use it everyday. It has helped me with my weigh loss journey. So many wonderful supportive people on there. I RECOMMENDED this APP. I lost 29 lbs unfortunately I gained it back but I recently lost 4 lbs and im on my way to lose more. This website helps you track food, water intake, exercise plus many other things. Get it you wont regret it plus is free :)
1126, While I find it a bit of a stretch to say this is part of the Jack Ryan story, it does provide the complete back story to one of the best characters in the Jack Ryan story line, Mr. Clark.  The story blends a human story with classic Clancy international politics and espionage better than any of his other works.  The read is enjoyable with multiple story lines running in parallel and converging with proper closer.  I miss the original cover art, but this is Clancy at his all around best.
1127, This charger is simply the best. I use it with my iPhone 5 and it works flawlessly. I'm getting almost 3 charges before the iTorch needs to be recharged. Never again will I worry about being stranded with a dead phone. Don't hesitate to buy one!UPDATE 4/7/13 - Unfortunately, I spoke too soon. In my enthusiasm I purchased a second charger shortly thereafter and that unit was DOA (would not turn on after a full charge). Since I still had faith in New Trent, I ordered a third charger and this one was also DOA. In all only 1 out of 3 chargers performed as expected. Very disappointed.
1128, These are complete cheaters. First of all, the charger never fit my N73 phone slot. Secondly, after I wrote my 1st review criticisizing the product, they called me up saying that they will send me a new replacement charger and I should remove my negative feedback from Amazon. I waited for almost 3 weeks and the charger never showed up. I tried calling the same number from where I got the call, and no response.Complete waste of money, waste of time and a useless product which I had to trash in 10 minutes after I received it.
1129, This is a novelty app with potential but is in way ready for release. Seems almost random as to whether it'll work from one phone to the next.On my own, a stock mytouch 4g, it sometimes works with the rear camera, sometimes doesn't. I've yet to get the flash to work at all, and despite it having the option fort the front camera it never worked.All in all it feels like an app that was never fully tested and was never ready for release.It really should be called a beta.
1130, This is a DVD release of an item that Kultur has had in their VHS catalog.  There are reviews of the VHS version, here on this website, which cover the excellent visuals, acting and setting.  So I will only add that the sound has not been improved enough to be satisfactory.  The Gergiev DVD is still the best way for general enjoyment of the opera.  There is a video version under Haitink, which I think is a better performance than the Gergiev, but unfortunately it has not had a commercial release.
1131, Can't say enough about the Lerato. One of my favorites in my closet since going on a &#34;shoes that won't kill my feet search&#34; this month. Finances kept me away from Naturalizer for many years. My feet have suffered. But back even if finances aren't much better. Life is too short to die in pain with your feet everywhere you go.I love the style & fit of this shoe. Ever feel like a favorite shirt or PJ is your buddy? This is how I feel about this shoe.I've gotten several colors. Would buy all if available. VERY comfortable shoe. Wear anywhere. Have the Camelot, Russet & my fav the Coffee Bean. The little brass buttons on them are a perfect design touch. No wonder there are so few left of this style.Note: I wear an 8.5W. This shoe runs long in heel so I exchanged for 8W. PERFECT!
1132, These pants are great. Color is true and doesn't run in the wash. They are roomy and fit comfortably. I haven't the need to wear a size larger as some other reviewers have mentioned. They fit as they should. Inseam fits true as well. The cargo pockets are generously sized and good for carrying pretty much anything. I find that it is easier to work in these pants than jeans, especially in warmer weather, due to the lighter weight and better range of motion that they allow. I would definitely buy another pair.
1133, I didn't know Valeo wipers until I saw them on a deal site.  Got them on a good deal from Amazon.com.  Installed 24" & 21" wipers on my 1999 Lexus RX300 in a few minutes.  They are very quiet during operation and cleans water and snow really well compared to the OEM wipers.  I used to struggle to get the early morning frost off, but now I turn the defrost and the wipers on and the frost is gone in a couple of minutes!Valeo 900-24-1B Frameless ULTIMATE All-Season Wiper Blade - 24"Valeo 900-21-1B Frameless ULTIMATE All-Season Wiper Blade - 21"I use Valeo 900-26-1B & Valeo 900-22-1B on my wife's 2005 Honda Odyssey Mini Van and the cleaning performance is several notches better than the Honda OEM wipers.Valeo 900-26-1B Frameless ULTIMATE All-Season Wiper Blade - 26"Valeo 900-22-1B Frameless ULTIMATE All-Season Wiper Blade - 22"
1134, I purchased these Columbia pants for my husband for Christmas.  I actually wanted them for an upcoming trip we will be taking to Paris; there is a side, zip pocket which will be very helpful to fend off pick-pockets.  This side zip pocket has a small, zipper pull that is essentially attached via a loop.  It can be removed (which we will do for travel) and then easily put back on without damaging it.  The pockets themselves are deep - another plus. The pants are nice looking and they must be comfortable, since he has been wearing them often!  The sage color is kinda like a grey-green khaki; it will go with many other colors.  The fit is slightly loose in the butt, but otherwise they look nice on and can be worn for most casual events.
1135, The magic behind this show is that it lets you see your life and the people in it and appreciate them for their humor and kindness.  It's not ful frontal comedy with laugh tracks, its about life and seeing the humor in it. All the situations are about Gavin and Stacey (who are great) but the power of the show are their friends and family, people we all know and have in our everyday life.  They are fullly developed characters portrayed without judgement,, from the uncle who loves outdated technology and will go on and on about it to 'Nessa who has lived life to its fullest.  Its also not a chick-flick  and will appeal to men as well as women.  Funny and real.
1136, The Floyd playing ECHOES part I in the sun-splashed arena by day as the camera tracks in slowly(awesome).Waters pounding the heck out of the gong on Saucerful of Secrets, slow motion sequences during One of These Days,  strangely lit scene during Set the Controls &amp; Wright's keyboarding,and  the making of Dark Side with interviews.Need I say more, this is the  definitive Floyd VHS.Non-Floyd fans don't even knock this one because if  you don't appreciate the Floyd then you won't like this anymore than you  would The Wall.
1137, This is an exciting series. An extra-terrestrial race crash lands in the US sometime in the 1960s or so. They have a kind of &#34;prime directive&#34; of causing no harm. Kept hidden (and apparently imprisoned) by the US government for decades. They appear human and are indistinguishable from other human population (except for DNA tests, which reveal differences). Some of this race escaped the initial crash and mingled with the local population. The series covers a time when a new US president finds out about the imprisoned aliens, meets with them, and decides to make their presence know and to release them from captivity.A series of events shows how diplomacy fails with incomplete information and leads to escalating strife between the races - causing the aliens to abandon their prime directive. Many new things keep being revealed about the aliens and their culture and the danger that they may pose to the human population.I liked it and hope that it is renewed.
1138, Have to agree with all the other comments about pirated copy. Good to have for historical value, but this is a washed out, low quality bootleg. The cover artwork is one step above old style computer pixelation and the label for the DVD is obviously semi-homemade.Unfortunately this is the only way to get this film (for the moment) as the general consensus regarding MMT is that it is a substandard product from the Beatles.Of course with the benefit of hindsight, its experimentation and sheer weirdness redeems it somewhat, I doubt we'll see any major remastering of this for some time. Buy this only if you're having a Magical Mystery Tour Ultra Fan Party and need a main attraction.
1139, These things got such bad reviews - that I ordered 3 just to be sure I got one good one (at least they're cheap). I gave them two stars instead of one since, oddly, 2 of 3 of them worked for their intended purpose (a size adapter for my iPhone), though none of them work when plugged into my PC. Hard to imagine this is a very difficult product to manufacture - so I just assume the manufacturer could simply care less...UPDATE: Turns out my 2 star review was way too generous. All 3 of these eventually stopped working properly. A truly staggering level of apathy by the manufacturer...
1140, In season two they maintain standards -- lovely period, good ensemble, with soapy story lines. But there is a weariness to it all. I think if it had gone to a third season it would have crumbled like a dry rotted piece of lace. Not a lot of laughs. Sometimes a little too much nobility and starchy knickers but you are drawn into the lives of the characters based on real archival material of the period. Nice glimpse of an interesting period in history. All in all, it makes for satisfying television.
1141, Even though the video quality isn't exactly perfect, this is a terrific concert to listen to and watch.  Nearly 20 songs in just over 90 minutes, and worth every minute.  His band features former members of The Tubes and Bourgeois Tagg, bands for whom Todd has served as producer over the years.  The normally staid Japanese audience goes wild for Todd at this show, and so will you.  I can't believe this concert was never released on CD -- it is THAT GOOD!  I found this video in a cut-out bin at Camelot Music in 1992 and I only had to pay $7.00 for it.  Best 7 bucks I ever spent!
1142, Robinson is an excellent writer and this is an excellent trilogy, but the emphasis is on science.  Those looking for light-reading action fantasy should look elsewhere.  On the other hand, if you love science fiction with meat to it and you find Mars fascinating, these are the books for you.Asimov, Heinlein, Clarke...no other science fiction author has ever put so much real science into his writing, and that's only half the appeal.  To get the full experience, allow yourself the time to follow the musings and personal journeys of Robinson's characters as well as the main plot.  Robinson's books are better savored than read.
1143, The cover art perfectly sums up the concert as described.This was filmed at the Red Rocks amphitheatre, way before U2 became stylized, glamorous stadium rockers. The hairstyles are super dorky and Bono shows some hot ass under skin tight black jeans, takes his shirt off and pulls a lady fan up to dance.The sound is LOUD, the music RAW and the then up and comers full of passion and fire. In comparison, the group seems somewhat fatigued in the 360 DVD.This 2008 remaster and reissue of U2 Live At Red Rocks Under A Blood Red Sky also includes some previously unreleased performances:Cry/The Electric CoAn Cat Dubh/Into The HeartTwo Hearts Beat As OneI highly recommend this and Zoo TV. I think these are their best DVDs.
1144, This video is pretty cool, but the only reason I gave this video &quot;4&quot; stars, instead of &quot;5&quot; is due to the fact that one of Rush's BEST songs is missing from the video...'Subdivisions'. I'm a little suprised that this song was not included in the video, especailly the fact that it 'is' on the &quot;A Show Of Hands&quot; live album. But, other than that, this video is not too bad. My favorite songs that I would like to point out from the video are...... &quot;The Big Money&quot;, &quot;Marathon&quot;, &quot;Force Ten&quot;, &quot;Mission&quot;,  &quot;Closer To The Heart&quot;, &quot;Red Sector A&quot;, &quot;YYZ&quot;, &quot;The Spirit Of Radio&quot;, &quot;Tom Sawyer, &quot;2112&quot;, and &quot;La Villa Strangiato&quot;. And also Neil's awesome drum solo, which is really cool! COOL video, but  could of used &quot;Subdivisions&quot;.
1145, This one blew me away. I started this book not suspecting much. Wow I was blown away. We start with a man named Kelly and well I can't really say more with out giving the book away. All I have to say is that this books rocks. Clancy takes you for a ride. There is so many sub-plots in this book. So you can never get bored with it. At one time Kelly is doing this then he is doing something with the CIA. I mean it is a big action pack thriller. The ending is what brings it all together to make all his other books make sence and I commened him for that.
1146, This gate is much better than most on the market. The design allows it to function well as a gate, yet allowing foot traffic through by the inclusion of a lockable door in the unit. The gate is made of metal, but I deducted 1 star due to the locking mechanism being made of plastic. Only time will tell how much real-world use it will stand up to. Another thing about this gate that I like is the flexibility offered by the availability of extensions -- it is possible to mount this gate pretty much anywhere needed. Overall, I am happy with this purchase.
1147, Perhaps these look better in smaller sizes.....I wear a 9 1/2 to 10M.  These looked so, so dorky on, I can't wear them.  They're very old lady-ish. Also, the collar of the shoe sticks out at the sides on me.  It isn't snug or even close to snug around my ankle area. It's not a stable sneaker...my foot was sliding around a bit, & yes, I had the correct size. I'd have to wear a thick sock, which would really push the dorkiness factor over the top.
1148, While automation and mass production have taken over the manufacturing sector of many industrialized nations, it's eye opening to watch how things are made. Whether big or small, delicate or delicious, high art or high speed, pick a season of this series and watch and be amazed. It's fascinating to watch how some of the most common things we see are made. After watching, however, the one thing I really want to know is how did someone come up with the ideas for the machines that make the machines?
1149, The New Trent battery pack is lightweight and small, and works easily and well.  My only beef with it is that the 5000mAh rating may not be accurate.  I compared it to a Zaggsparc 2.0, which is rated to same capacity, and the Zaggsparc clearly carries more "juice."  However, Zagg's product is more than twice the cost!  So, for my money, this is the better buy.  The charging cables it uses can be a bit more cumbersome than some other options out there, but the cable is retractable, which is nice, and again, it's a much better price.  If you're looking for something to extend the usable battery life of your smartphone, this is what you want.
1150, The cheapest place in town to get this is AutoZone and they want $39.99 for it.  At $25, free shipping and no tax, this is a smoking hot deal.  Just a note, I'm putting this on mowers and ATVs.  The cost of a replacement battery is about $40 for a mower and as much as $100 for the ATVs.  So this is a no brainer here.It plugs directly into the wall and comes with about a 6' cord, a permanent battery connection and a second connection with big alligator clips.  So you can put the permanent part on one piece of equipment and use the alligator clips on something else if need be.
1151, I first heard of Slint when Steve Albini was raving about them, and then also when I bought the KIDS soundtrack, Slint's &quot;Good Morning, Captain&quot;, off this album, was on it. &quot;Good Morning, Captain&quot; is such a terrific song, and it propelled me to go and buy all of Slint's stuff. The first album I bought by Slint was &quot;Tweez.&quot; I wasn't immediately impressed by this album, but it grew on me.I then bought &quot;Spiderland&quot;, which I have listened to over and over again, and then I listened to &quot;Tweez&quot; and it just sounded that much better because I was used to their precise, mathematical style of music that they play.&quot;Spiderland&quot; is just an amazing album. I like this album so much that it has rendered me incapable of trying to describe how good it is. My only recommendation is that you buy it and hear what I'm talking about.
1152, I needed a gate for the top of the stairs, and searched Amazon for "baby gate top of stairs."  This gate is the second item returned.  Nowhere in the description does it say that this gate should not be used at the top of the stairs.  Of course as soon as we opened the box the instructions clearly say DO NOT USE AT THE TOP OF STAIRS.  The gate works great in the upstairs hallway, but we'll still need to buy a different gate at some point if we want the baby to have access to our room.
1153, It's free, is on the cloud (accessible from anywhere, not just one computer), works WELL with my phone, can be customized, & offers free sync with my Fitbit.Gives insights into deficits in vitamin/mineral intake from your diet. I never would have realized that I was potassium deficient; adding a small V8 before exercise eliminated leg cramps during exercise. I wouldn't know that without the feedback from this app.Be sure to use tools to calculate your BMR calories & be sure to eat at least that many calories to prevent starvation mode. (Go to the free forums for more details.)  Forums provide excellent insights & positive, non- judgmental support.
1154, By any and all standards Thelonious Monk belongs amongst the most unique musicians and composers ever produced by this country. Thanks to Clint Eastwood, Monk's genius and odd behaviour will be preserved for future generations in a way that books could never hope to completely portray. The outstanding thing about Monk was his uniqueness and individuality. Yes he could play with other musicians and he could play compositions by other composers but regardless of what he played or who he played with, you always knew it was Monk. Others copied him but no one duplicated him and sadly there are very, very few artists/composers out there today with an original sound or style. I wish more people would wake up to the true genius of Monk and that may happen one day. And if it does, Mr. Eastwood should get a great deal of credit for his efforts and support.
1155, I love my fitness pal and think it's an invaluable tool for calorie counting and tracking your exercise goals.  However, I do not feel that the projected weight loss will ever be accurate when it's simply measuring single day calorie consumption.  The app is great for tracking calories and fitness goals though.  Just don't expect your weightloss to be as amazing as they project (or at times, as little as they project)...and remember, it is never healthy to starve yourself.  I think this application can encourage people to eat too few calories, making their body go into &#34;starvation mode&#34;.

1157, If you want a monitor that's super sensitive, get this one. I could be laying in bed in the same room as the baby bed, and my husband will come in from another room cause he heard the baby fuss when I couldn't. I'm not kidding, the way we know when we've got it to the correct volume is when we can hear the clock ticking. I can't hear the clock just sitting a few feet away from it, but this baby monitor can hear it clear across the room.Just don't unplug the transmitter while the receiver is still on... it's LOOOOOOOOOUD static.
1158, The wool shoe part is lovely and warm and stretches. The same is true with the wool ankle part. But someone FAILED TERRIBLY in the design because where the two parts are joined, the heavy stitching does not stretch and is so tight  it feels like a tourniqet and after ten minutes there is a deep compression mark left on your instep. This is where the blood flow to your feet has been restricted. Wearing them for any length of  time leads to foot pain. I tried without success to stretch this stitching to no avail. What a shame. And yes, these are my correct size in every other way. A good idea but worthless because the construction wasn't thought through enough. Go back to the drawing board Muk Luks Company,I would really like these if you got it right.
1159, I must thank all the other reviewers for warning that this shirt fits large. I bought a size down from my usual and it fit well.The Bahama shirt looks and fit very similar to the Bonehead and the Tamiami. However, the material for all 3 shirts are rather different. The Bonehead is cotton, the Bahama and the Tamiami are both synthetic type material which have different UV protection abilities. I must say that I like the Tamiami as it offers the best UV protection and has the nicest fabric of the 3. But this is subjective and many would prefer cotton. The Bahama has a different pocket deign from the Tamiami and again I personally prefer the Tamiami.It is a good shirt however and Amazon offers a pretty competitive price for it. Happy overall with it.
1160, I have a 4.5 month old and these newborn nipples are too fast for my breastfed baby. He guzzles a 4 ounce bottle in less than 5 minutes, which is HORRIBLE for a breastfed baby. He doesnt know when hes full and ends up spitting up a ton after feeds. He also ends up with an upset tummy and is extra gassy because of them. Since this is the slowest flow Avent offers, Ive had to look for new bottles. I wish they made slower flow nipples because I really do like the bottles.
1161, If you're looking for a tiny bathtub for your itty-bitty newborn baby, this might not be what you had in mind.  It's big.  It's not the sort of bathtub you plop in or on top of your kitchen sink (unless you've got a pretty big sink and you're very tall).  I actually use this inside our regular bathtub when bathing my daughter.  I used a bath cushion to give her extra support and comfort on her back/head when she was unable to sit up on her own.  And though she's able to sit up now, using this bath makes so much more sense than filling up the regular bathtub (which would require way more water).  I definitely foresee myself using this bath for my 7 month-old for several more months, and possibly a couple more years.
1162, The information on this product states that this item it will fit most RV's.  Not so, not even close.  There is no way to even motifiy this item to make it work.  Was a total waste of money.  I've had RV's for over 40+ years, and have never even seen a gutter even close to what this will fit.  Not even worth sending back due to the shipping return charges being more that this product cost.  Would not recommend this product to anyone. To bad you have even give it one star, in order to leave a review
1163, WARNING: DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT FOR $40+ DOLLARS.  This product is perhaps the greatest I ever used on my chest and back.  It completely cleared up my acne on those parts of my body and kept it clear.  So, as you can imagine, I was pretty upset when I heard it was discontinued.  I never found anything quite like it.  Today, I went to Walgreens and happened to stumble into the face/body wash (essentially acne) area, and saw a tag for this bar!  I was so happy!  I asked the clerk if it was being back into production and she said yes!  If it's not in your local store yet, it should be by the end of this week (September 17, 2011)!  Don't pay $40+ for it, it's coming BACK IN STOCK for around $8.50!
1164, I bought these for my mother who is a little unsteady on her feet in the colder elements. Our first concern was that she would trip on them since she can shuffle her feet a bit, but these were not a problem. She was concerned about slipping on them but also not a concern since when she steps down, they &#34;smush&#34; into the shoe. She was very surprised how comfortable on her shoes they were, how she barely noticed them when walking and how easy it was to use them in/out of the car and working the pedals.
1165, I usually eat when I'm hungry, so if I don't feel hungry I don't bother.  Most of the time I just open a can of campbell chicken noodle soup and I'm good to go. Now I decided due to health reason I need to keep tab of what I'm putting in my body a health counselor at work advise me to try this program so I can keep a food diary.  Now that I'm using this program it's been telling me I'm not eating enough calories.  I even started to exercise so I can document that as well. Thank you whoever created this program now I need one for when I  go shopping so I can know what is healthy and unhealthy to purchased.  Any ideas anyone reading this?
1166, After reading the other reviews, I decided to get a large rather than a medium.  I tend to wear anywhere from a size 8 to a 12, depending upon the item.  When I received these, I loved them, but they are not tight enough to be considered compression tights at all.  I kept them rather than returning, because they are still useful for cold weather running, and they are very comfortable, well-made and otherwise very nice.  I also did not have a problem with the ankle elastic as some other reviewers mentioned.  I'm writing this review in case there are other people trying to decide about which size to get- I wish I had gotten them a bit smaller.  If you're between sizes, size down!
1167, It's been more than a year, and I haven't had a chance to try these out yet, but they certainly look well constructed and seem to do what they were designed to do. The one thing that might be helpful for people to know is that the instructions say to wear these on ice/snow only. Therein lies my problem. I wanted something for walking my dog in the neighborhood on those snowy winter days when some people haven't cleared their sidewalks, the snow melts, ice forms, and it's horrendous. The problem is that some people do completely clear their sidewalks and some don't. Also, the snow trucks clear a lot of the streets. So I might get out there, have them work in some places, and then ruin them when I walk on asphalt or concrete. Just a little FYI.
1168, While this was no Ben Hur, I enjoyed the movie.  The few twists and turns in there made it worth watching not only once, but twice.  It's not going to be something anybody relies on for historical data, but it should entertain those same people an hour or so.The scenery of Scotland was just as I remembered it from my young adulthood; wild and wet.  Seeing Dominic West as something other than McNulty from The Wire was interesting as well.If you've a free bit of time and just want entertained for the sake of entertainment, I can easily recommend this movie.  If you want something deep and meaningful, I suggest you look elsewhere.
1169, Teena Marie has proven to be more than just a regular soul singer.  No, she's WAY more than simply that.  She's also a really good pop/rock songwriter, delivers really amazing vocal melodies, and even makes danceable music remarkably fun and refreshing.  The music of hers that resembles disco or new wave such as "I Need Your Lovin" is VERY melodic, exciting, and what I strongly consider overall quality songwriting.  Teena Marie may have left this world, but her music will live on forever.  Pick up anything she did in the early 80's for a chance to experience quality underrated music that never should have left radio stations to begin with.  You'd think radio stations could at least respect her career by playing a few of her hits, but nope.  I've heard nothing in the last few days on ANY FM radio station.  What a shame.  Teena Marie is excellent though.  Beautiful face, beautiful vocals, *great* music.
1170, One of my favorites heroes, besides Jack Ryan, in Tom Clancy's books is John Clark. He is a dark figure with a mysterious past. He's a man admired for his action and his word. He works in black ops but has his own moral code. Clark is a man of action. This book essentially covers Clark's past. His girlfriend was murdered by Baltimore drug dealers who raped her while slowly asphyxiating her with a plastic bag. A horrific death that profoundly affects Clark. But he doesn't mope nor sit idly by. This ex-SEAL sets out upon a course of justice. He dispenses justice in the only way these murderous scum understand - by executing the drug dealers who peddle their death and addiction to adults and children. Clancy uses the story to give us greater backstory on Jack Ryan. His father, Emmet Ryan, is a detective trying to track down the killer of these drug dealers. But Clark keeps moving forward `Without Remorse'.
1171, Got this game as a FAOTD. I wasn't expecting much from a free game, and also expecting lots of developer request to 'upgrade' or to have unreal permissions. Not the case. I was really surprised at how well the game plays - and no obnoxious ads.Easy to learn, so if you've always been afraid to sit down at a real Blackjack table, this will show you the easiest way to learn and just might make you some money some day. It's a great time killer that is fun to play and can help you learn to be a better player.
1172, This is by far the best free weight loss app I found and I looked at (downloaded) quite a number of them! This app will allow you to scan the barcode of any food item and will pull all the nutrition info from the internet for you. If you don't have a camera, like me on my Kindle Fire, just enter the name of the food and hit the search button and you are instantly provided a list of all items in the database for your search. If you want to track you calories and other nutritional info, this is the ap for you!
1173, I already have this game on my Mac from the Mac App store, so I'm familiar with it and have enjoyed it as a quick time-killer. Seeing it available for my Galaxy S, and for free no less, seemed like a no brainer.Unfortunately, the game is broken. When getting a bonus jump the game freezes for ~30 seconds (I timed it) about half the time. And every time I reach the High Score banner it locks entirely, requiring that I hold down the power button and reboot the phone.C'mon, guys. The game isn't that complicated. I *really* want to like the Android version, and I hope that an update comes out soon. Until it does I'll be leaving it installed, but won't be playing it and certainly wouldn't recommend it. :-(
1174, I didn't know this was what was already on my car when I bought another to replace it. When removing the existing one I found moisture had made its way into the components inside, under the cap. I would take an educated guess that it was due to an inferior o-ring or bad vent cap. There was some oxidation on various parts and even some rust, which I've never seen in any other vehicles I've owned over the past 20 yrs. The matching rotor was a PITA to remove, which I will explain in the rotor review. I won't buy this or the rotor again.
1175, I have tested this device pretty extensively for work and home. Some observations:1) If the signal is fairly strong without the booster, the booster *seems* to actually slow down data transfer speeds. I don't know if it's because you're inserting one more "relay" between the cell tower and the wireless device, but I have tested ths scenario in various places and the results appear to be fairly consistent.2) If you are in a place with no signal or a very, very weak signal, the device will almost never help.3) The scenarios where the device works best are the ones where you have one and maybe two bars and have dropped or very poor quality calls. There is no doubt that in at least some scenarios like these, the device will improve the signal to the point where you may be able to make and keep a call.This device is not a silver bullet, but it can help in certain scenarios.
1176, I really enjoyed the perfect spiral curls this curling iron made.  It took me a couple tries to finally get it right.  I give it four stars only because it took about double the time it takes me to use a clipless wand, and for some reason even though I had it on the highest heat setting and used hairspray, my spirals became loose waves after a few hours (They were still pretty waves though!).  I will most likely use this as a back up or for special occassions only because it was so time consuming.
1177, We were getting geared up for the Winwood - Clapton tour last year and thought it would be nice to check Traffic out live. I wish I would have saved the money as this was just terrible in every aspect - poor audio, poor video and a completely un-inspired and low on talent (at the time) Steve Winwood. Catch him later on as he actually could play additional riffs on his keyboard. this was embarrasing for anyone who thinks they remember Traffic, minus Dave Mason, who WAS the heart of that band. Sorry, Jim Capaldi.
1178, This is by far the best purchase we've made for our son - at 2 months old he was 16 lbs, and too big for most tubs.  This one is perfect.  He absolutely LOVES it - he kicks and splashes and has so much fun in the bath!  It's very supportive, but at the same time, he has a lot of freedom to play.  Our 7 month old nephew took a bath in it the other night, and he loved it as well.  He sat up where my son lies, and also had support and freedom at the same time.  It's too large for our kitchen cabinet, but it works well inside a bathtub.  I would absolutely recommend it to any and every parent and/or grandparent.  Just be ready with your video camera the first time you put your child in it!
1179, I use Mobil 1 synthetic oil in my vehicles.  I use this particular Mobil 1 filter on a high mileage mini-van that can go longer between oil changes than cars used to.  I keep an eye on the color and clarity of the oil over time, and this filter does a good job - better than some less expensive ones I've used.  I have gotten 5,000 miles and more out of these filters, and never had a problem with one.  The threads are strong, so that screwing it in place has never resulted in a stripping of the threads, nor has one ever come loose.  I would recommend these filters.
1180, If you've seen movies like this over the years and even up to Gladiator with Russell Crowe, then you already have an idea what the movie is about. You already know there's going to action and will it entertain you.For us it did. We relaxed and enjoyed it. It's NOT Gladiator. It's realistic and well choreographed, sound is good, the acting is good and the scenery is enjoyable.The film quality is good as well. It's not going to WOW you but it can and should entertain you if you like these kinds of movies.I give it 5 stars because I already had an idea of what to expect from other reviews and yet when the movie was done, I was glad we bought it.
1181, first, this series is filmed in Nova Scotia (Eastern Canada), and the town setting is in Haven, Maine, in a small, quaint, fishing village.  The town itself is a "character" in the series, because the "troubles" (supernatural bizarre occurances) are due to the town itself, and some old curse.  The cinematography of the area is very beautiful (makes you want to pack your bags and move there).Now, moving on...the characters are well-written.  Emily Rose plays a FBI agent who comes to Haven to investigate a case and chooses to stay there indefinitely to pursue the possibility that her mother may have disappered there years earlier.Another main character is the chief of police, who often works together with the FBI agent in trying to solve these bizarre cases- so there is a Mulder-Scully dynamic (X-Files) between them.* one of the best shows currently on syfy- recommended viewing *
1182, Like too many shows, there's a good hook, then the show is not renewed.  I would have liked to see at least one more season (assuming the writers could maintain the intensity & plot).  The season reached a point with some openings for a second season.This is definitely sci-fi, but not &#34;space aliens&#34;, invasions by bugs, or other crap like that.  It's sci-fi enough to be beyond our world experiences, but not so far as to be incredulous.I enjoyed every episode.
1183, I do not use after shave and instead opt to use this product. It seems to help with moisture, any cuts, doesn't sting, helps with breakouts, etc. It really is a great product but it does have that tea tree smell that does NOT really disappear. I get whiffs of it off/on during the entire day. I hardly doubt that others will smell it unless they're licking your cheek but you will be able to smell it. I'd rather have great skin with a medicinal scent that isn't all that bad!! This is great product at a very reasonable price!
1184, My wife and I recently stayed in a hotel that had a wall mounted mirror in the bathroom. We quickly realized how nice it would be to have one at home in our bathroom. I found this mirror, read the reviews, and made the purchase. We could not be any happier! I use it to shave and my wife loves it for doing her makeup.+ Simple to Install+ Easily Folds Out+ Retains Any Position+ Very Clear Image+ Two Sides+ Easily Rotates+ Flush Against Wall Saving Space+ Price_Bottom Line_ Yes, I would recommend this wall mounted bathroom mirror. I have had it for several weeks and love it. Previously I used a hand mirror with a stand...not anymore! This is a simple upgrade to the bathroom that is really nice to have. I recommend holding it up to the wall where you plan to put it first. I had to move it down because I put it up too high. Great product. Easy 5 stars.
1185, The second the Beatles step foot off the plane at JFK, the US was never the same. Here it the film  that proves that statement .Captured in black and white are the sights and sounds of the Beatles in NYC in 1964. The highlights that gets this  DVD  repeated viewing is that all of the boy's songs  performances from Ed Sullivan's really big show are included.What is sometimes forgotten in the history of the Beatles is that they were a hell of a live rock and roll band. After these performance on Sullivan we would never see the Beatles play  like this again. The public view of  John Paul George and Ringo goes from this moment in time , to  Hard Days Night, which is a recreation of this moment . Then check out the opening shot of Help.  It features the Beatles all dressed  in black, not smiling and their eyes saying "we are not the really Fab Four any more. Now thanks to this DVD we can relive our baby steps of Rock
1186, I saw this concert in Nassau Coliseum in New York in 1988. It was a great show. This would be a 5 star video but there are two problems with it. One is the slow motion during their playing, very bothersome. Two, what happened to the opening song "Shine On You Crazy Diamonds", there is only the last three or four minutes of it as the show starts. The song live was about 12 or 13 minutes long as heard on the CD. Please when you guys bring this to DVD give us the show as it was seen from the audience, I'm sure the film is in the archives waiting to show us the concert, the whole show. Please get rid of the special effects. Take a note from Roger Waters' DVD of "In the Flesh" which is a great DVD. Also saw that show in The Garden in 2000. If it doesn't come to DVD, a crime, then to Pink Floyd fans this will do.
1187, VERY GOOD  AUDIO-VIDEO,  GREAT  SONG SELECTION.  TODD IS AT HIS BEST IN THIS OLDER VIDEO. HE HAS  A FULL BAND, AND BACKUP VOCALISTS, AS  COMPARED TO JUST HIM, A BASS & DRUMMER, IN LIVE  IN SAN FRAN. STAY AWAY FROM THAT ONE IT STINKS. LIAR IS ALSO VERY GOOD IF YOU LIKE THE  LIAR CD YOU WILL LIKE THE LIAR DVD. BUT AS A VERY LONG TIME TODD FAN SINCE HE BEGAN WITH NAZZ, THIS IS REALLY VERY GOOD.  HIS BAND IS GREAT, HIS VOICE IS AT ITS BEST.  HE PLAYS VERY LITTLE GUITAR ON THIS DVD, AND LIAR. BUT THE GUITAR PLAYER IS EXCELLENT.  LIVE IN JAPAN IS WELL WORTH THE  MONEY.
1188, First of all, the sound for the concert is clearly cleaned up, as I heard this show when it hit the radio the first time.  There were points in the radio show that were clearly unlistenable.I know some Floyd purists won't like all of the guest stars, but they are not bad half the time.  Bryan Adams works fairly effectivly, and Paul Carrack on Hey You is even better than the original.  On the other hand, Cyndi Lauper on Another Brick 2 and Sinead and the Band really take away from some otherwise powerful songs.The imagery of this show is spectacular, as it must have been for the original tour (do they have an entire concert for that?).  It translates to video quite nicely, something which wasn't transmitted for the Momentary Lapse tour.I'd say this is a nice one to get if you're a Floyd or Waters fan, but keep an open mind.
1189, I obtained a BZ60 for a V3m because this is a slim battery. Same voltage but higher current rating than the battery which came with the phone (780mAh). Yes, I can get the battery door closed.First charge cycle: battery didn't seem to last as long as expected. Second charge cycle: much better. By the third charge cycle, I'm anticipating it outperforming the battery it replaced. I'm just making sure for the first few charges, it gets a chance to completely drain before I'm re-charging it.Update: I'm finding the battery doesn't really last much longer than the one it replaces. If I take a few calls, the battery life falls off pretty quickly. I do have a MicroSD card installed in the phone which is about 1/3rd full of personal music. I didn't think the SD card would take much power to retain it's contents. Oh well... The price is good.
1190, The armband is hard and is exact fit for my iPhone 3GS. That seems to be a good news; but it makes it quite hard to put iPhone inside and take it out. Would not recommend if you are going to swap your phone in and out frequently. Also once phone is in, there is no way to access volume buttons. Only way to control volume is through the screen and that is absolutely not convenient. Overall, its good enough for its price; but I wouldn't have mind paying a bit more and getting a better band.
1191, Kim Stanley Robinson's "Red/Green/Blue Mars" series is one of the great trilogies about Mars colonization.  What makes it great is the science is believable and the character interactions spot on.  This is not a series about bug-eyed monsters and ray guns, this is about humans colonizing Mars and the challenges they will face: technical, environmental, social, and political.  I bought a hard back set for myself and lend my well-worn paperback set to friends.  I am now reading more of Ms. Robinson's books which is the best recommendation I could give.
1192, It's a Timex!  That means it keeps surprisingly accurate time for an inexpensive watch.  At first I thought the strap was going to be its weak point; but it has held up like a champ for nearly three years of daily wear as in 7days a week daily.  The crystal is slightly recessed, which has kept it scratch free in all that time.  However, the bevel has no fared as will.  Most of the silver coating over the plastic housing has worn off.  It there were some safe way to replace it, this watch would be invincible.  And best of all the battery shows no signs of wearing out yet.It looks nice on the wrist and is light and airy, removing one of the biggest complaints about a resin strap, that it is stiff and sweaty.  I will soon be replacing it with another.  Perhaps I will go for a different color this time........
1193, This is by far the easiest Sudoku to use, it has an option to chose the difficulty level of your puzzle, you can pause and turn off your kindle and it remembers where you were.  You can either continue a previous game or start a new one.  This is so much better than paper, I play it endlessly, and vary the difficulty of the puzzle. It keeps a little record of your best times for each level of puzzle, and it's fun to see if you can beat an old record, or I can just relax and try different strategies.  There is a way to put in &#34;possible&#34; answers, without losing track of which numbers you are more sure of.  Awesome, no spam, no ads, just Sudoku.
1194, This thing is awsome!!  I use it for my iphone 4 and I don't know how I lived without it! I keep it with me when I'm on the go with no charger around. On my first full charge, I was able to successfully charge me iphone 4 from 20% to full about 3 times.  From my experience it takes about 1 hour for every 20% to charge.My only wish is that it came with a cable or a somewhat, built it cable. Or at least a case that can carry both the battery and an iphone cable.
1195, Bosch Evolution All-Season Bracketless Wiper Blades do a great job of clearing the windshield of just about every drop of rain/water.  After a couple months of use they continue to work very well and perform as advertised.They have pretty good tension against the windshield even though they are bracketless.  I do find that around some ends that the wiper does not make full contact and some water escapes.  Also, when driving at higher speeds or in high winds sometimes the blade can lift.Overall, I'm pretty pleased with the Evolution wipers.  There are some minor issues, but they provide excellent coverage and clearing ability.
1196, I really like this concert. As already mentioned, the video is not that great but acceptable considering the source. The sound quality is outstanding. I love the fact that this concert is available on the BD in mp3 format. I didn't realize it when I purchased this that in order to get the mp3s you need to have a BD player on your computer.What I would really like seems to be missing from every concert I have bought so far in the BD format. That is - a digital copy that I could transfer to my computer or iPod. I've got lots of digital copies of movies which I never use. Only once have I ever watched a movie on my ipod and the experience was not very satisfying. If I had digital copies of concerts however, I would be very happy to put those on my ipod and play them since I would be caring more about the sound.I hope a few manufacturers read this post and take it to heart!
1197, It's amazing how much was written without actually progressing anything to a satisfactory plot point.I'll admit that at first the series was intriguing and novel in approach, but it's now gone to a point of bloated ridiculous.  Too many characters, too much focus on things I couldn't give two sneezes about, all the while seeming to completely blitz over the characters (and plots) I liked accepting of course that the author didn't kill them first.In truth I've spent more time thinking about how I'd have liked the series to this point to be written than finding merit in how it was actually written and prayed for the first time in my known life that the Television adaptation of this now monstrosity severely edits it into something manageable and far more enjoyable for it.I honestly don't think I'll buy the next book, as much as on a point of principle for how annoyed I am with how this book was written.
1198, I read this book quite a few years ago.  I could give you all my very detailed opinion of this book -- I loved it, it would be easy -- but I would never do the book justice.  Suffice to say the characters are marvelously drawn (years later I still think about them) and the plot marvelously intricate.  I've even gotten my mom and sister to read the Trilogy and they both loved it.  What it all comes down to is you should buy it (or borrow it if you must to get your hands on it) and read it (and the other two in the Trilogy --&gt; Green Mars &amp; Blue Mars).  You won't be disappointed...and you certainly won't regret it.
1199, The product arrived timely and the packaging is wonderful. I've used Mavala Stop since I received it and although it hasn't completely prevented my granddaughter from sucking her two fingers, she is aware that she will receive the &#34;painting&#34; on her fingers if she places them in her mouth. I feel it is helping in the sense that she knows the taste isn't something she likes.  That alone is a help for me.  I'm confident that she will eventually be more aware of Mavala Stop and discontinue this habit. I have nothing negative to say about this product since it does make my granddaughter aware of what will happen if she doesn't follow the instructions and keep those fingers where they should be.
1200, I pretty much agree with everyone else here, though I admit I am curious as to the color wash-out on DVD, I can readily understand how the VHS might be more enjoyable if the visuals are more strikingly transferred. The sound transfer is not very good, not horrible, but the very first chords are attenuated and it sounds like someone upped the volume than and was too lazy to do it over. It is filmed on a huge stage, so the dancers are given lots of room to strut their stuff, but a filming of a live performance might have been, well, livlier. There is an emotional flatness about the whole endeavor, though Act Two emerges more effectively in that regard than Act One. The score is cut rather significantly, yup those peasants are gone in Act One.If you want a GISELLE at a budget, this isn't the world's worst choice, but I'd save a few pennies and go elsewhere.
1201, Purchased these shorts for our 12 year old daughter in extra small.  Size was perfect.  However, the waist band on all 4 pairs of shorts we ordered was not the same.  The product picture shows a white waistband on the Soffe shorts.  Our shorts did not have a white waistband.  Not sure how much this will matter to most people.Other than the issue with the product description, we found the shorts to be of high quality material and stitching, just like all our previous purchases. Sizing was accurate. We also bought them on sale for an incredible price where we essentially received 3 pairs for the price of one (not all sizes and color were available however).So, if the waistband color is a non-issue, I would definitely recommend these shorts. Amazon usually has lower prices than I can find locally.
1202, In this book we finally get to know Mr. Clark.  Clancy, unlike he does in his other books, focuses a lot on a love story which is the basis for the action in this book.  Although Mr. Clark's military skills are talked about in great description, it is not another military he ends up using them against.  His fight is against drug dealers and pimps, and the story is great.  One has to read it to understand because this is not the typical "love story", in fact it is a love story that you would think Clancy would write.  Kudo's to Clancy on his endeavor out of the normal military novel.  I hope we get more books focusing on Mr. Clark and his group, Rainbow Six (another great Clancy book).
1203, I purchased this after reading many reviews.  I tested this prior to install and it did have issues turning very fast, however when they built my house they left the water pressure on the low side....barely over 30psi.  Once I bumped it up it worked better.  Installation was pretty easy.The hose they give you that hooks up to the garden hose was not long enough to reach the other side of the camper so I had to mount the bracket on the bumper...I will extend this someday.
1204, In this chapter the history of the Eurythmics, Sophie Muller begins the creative process and collaboration in a successful, where she makes music with images, Annie Lennox putting a woman on a pedestal / Diva, the images are a bit obscure, but so insightful report, our frustrations Emotional everyday, like you Have Place a Chill in My Heart, sorry that this video as well as the We Two are One Too on DVD have not left yet, that was so comprehensive that we live in, luckily an injustice that still exists in its raw form wild and why not!
1205, First of all, I paid 78 cents for 10 of these. Shipping and all! I would NEVER trust them to hold the weight of my cell phone. The string is about as thick as fishing line. The ring is about 1/4 inch in diameter. The loop is only big enough to put three fingers thru them. This was a bad investment but for 78 cents I can't complain too much. I just CANNOT recommend them nor will I ever use them. There are far better lanyards out there and for not much extra money. DON'T BUY THESE!!
1206, This has got to be one of the worst concert dvd's of all time.  I got stung by Sting on this Police concert.  The visuals are horrible home footage and the audio is almost unbearable.  I was NOT impressed nor would I recommend this to any Police/Sting fan at all.  Save your money and await a better dvd concert from this band/musician.  2 thumbs down.  It may be noted you cannot navigate from main menu all the songs easily;  you must use the FF and rewind buttons to fully cue up each song.  This dvd gives a really bad impression to folks that do not know the quality of the Police and Sting have made a great name for.  Bad mis-representation.
1207, These tights have a super pearlescent sheen, it's not too over the top that I can't wear it to the office. I've had guys comment on my lovely hose, only I know they're ogling my proud ballet legs heehee.They are super opaque, and feel very compression sturdy - which may be too snug for some depending on how you like your fit The seams have lasted my stretching beyond any other brand. They've held up so well at the gusset I've bought myself more in every color.I'm 5'2&#34; and 115 lbs I buy the smallest size (A) they feel very snug I could probably go for the next one up and struggle less with getting them on, but they are comfy for me and never droop through the day.
1208, We got this bath for our newborn. Unfortunately we weren't able to use it until very recently when she turned 4 m.o. The issue is that the triangle stopper is very wide on newborn side and my girl was crying when we put her in this tub. Even now she prefers to lay her legs on top of the stopper, not around.So for the first 4 months we used the infant bath seat made by the same company that was absolutely great. And the stopper in this seat is much narrower and much more comfortable for a baby.
1209, I normally don't go for fiction much anymore, but I'll make an exception for this excellent tale.  Flashman is like the Forrest Gump of the plains.  He is kidnapped by or meets the most famous outlaws, soldiers, native americans and politicians of the mid 1800's West, even participates in Custer's massacre.  All carefully footnoted and fitted to the real history itself.  Why this book has not been made into a movie I can't imagine, although Little Big Man seems to have been an attempt at it.  The books that the author references form the better part of my library at the moment, and I still have a number of them left to read.  Fascinating.
1210, The avent nipples are our babies favorite, 6 months flows really fast, the 3 month (3hole) is what we still use at her 6 months. If you use cereal, you will need the 4 hole (6month) to get done in a resonable time!!!!formula normal eater= 3 hole (3 month)Formula slow easter= 2 hole (entry)Formula normal eater with Cereal= 4 hole (6 month)Our girl eats formula, and cereal with veggies anf fruit. she does not get cereal in the bottle, as it took to long, but when she is ready to eat quickly we will go to the 4 hole (6 month)nipple.All in all, beast the rest, buy the best!!
1211, We bought this because my 2 year old lost the cord to our old monitor.  This is a cheap monitor that does the job.  If you are looking for crystal clear & no interference then you will have to spend more than $16.  It does have some occasional interference, but you just move it a little or switch the channel & it is fine.  It also has some "white noise" in the background much of the time, but it's minimal.  It is a cheap, simple monitor that works well.  It fit our budget & our needs and I have been happy with it.
1212, I not only don't see any difference after using almost the whole bottle, but it doesn't provide any temporary benefits either.  It makes my face look a little greasy, and there is not much of a cosmetic difference.  My skin doesn't really look better after I apply it.  But I have tried worse.  I don't think I will buy it again.  I'd rather try something else.  One thing though-it doesn't make my eyes burn like some other moisturizers with an SPF.
1213, so surprised at the ratings for this book that i had to put my 2 cents in ......have read the trilogy 2x, and will read it again at some point, i know.it is a fairly difficult book, as are all of kim stanley robinson's books. i've read them all. this is not easy reading. and no, i am not so completely thrilled at knowing so much about rocks, but......"red mars" is in my top 10 books of ALL TIMES. yes, i really love this book. i suggested it for my book club, who are def not sci-fi readers at all, and yet they all loved it.not a summer beach book. but the characters are real to me, and the continuation of their lives in the next two books makes you feel like you've had a special experience.just read it. you'll see......
1214, I really like this calories counter app. I use it on my Kindle Fire. I really enjoy the convenience of use,as well as theNice,big "calories remaining" number so I know with a quick glance what I have for the day.It has a large database of foods to browse,or I can create ny own entries easily. Weight,and measurements can also be tracked,as well as exercise. I really like the way progress is graphed so it can be easily assessed at a glance too. Very nice, free app. Would reccomend.
1215, I used this to help bathe my mom who was sick in the hospital. She was in the final stages of lung cancer. She could barely walk, talk, or move. Just standing was difficult, so going to the bathroom to shower was out of the question. She stayed in the hospital for around 3 weeks. I just put this solution into a tub of water and gently wiped her body every other day. The smell was calming and not intense. It did not leave a residue or stickiness. I also bought the no rinse shampoo.
1216, Rain-X Washer Fluid Additive works far better than I expected it to. I had serious doubts about getting the same results seen in the advertising, but after about a week of using the treated washer fluid my car's window was really "beading" water.It is interesting to watch the difference between rain water on the treated area (where my wipers push the washer fluid) and the non-treated areas. It is very clear that this is working when you see the water quickly rolling away.This is a great product! Highly Recommended!
1217, I absolutely love this app!!!  It has really helped me keep a closer eye on what I am eating and just how much to eat. Most every food has been preprogrammed in the app and it is so easy to find what you are looking for, even restaurant foods are easy to find!!!  In just 2 weeks time I have lost 8 pounds by using this app and walking for 20 minutes 3 days a week!  That is so manageable even in a very busy life!  Hope Springs for 2013 using this app!!
1218, This hands-free gate works when you step down on the foot paddle which causes a latch to open. You can then push the gate open with a hand or a knee. The gate is fairly easy to install (a necessary slim wrench is included in the box) and requires no screws or glue. The gate provides good protection. The bars on the gate are well-spaced so even small infants shouldn't be able to crawl through. When properly installed, it provides solid protection, although (important!) you should regularly check it to make sure it's securely affixed to the door frame. Also, over time the gate tends to bend a little, so you should use the little wrench-like tool to adjust it when necessary.In short, a very good gate for keeping kids out of a certain room. But this is *NOT* designed and should never be used to guard the top of a stairway.
1219, MacLean delivers another fun adventure in this 1983 yarn about a World War II espionage mission.  Pete Peterson and his motley crew of maybe-Chetniks maybe-Partisans cross Italy and Yugoslavia to deliver a message and unmask  a double agent.  The characters are MacLean classics:  beautiful patrician  women, evil assassins, stalwart companions, and a glib and brilliant hero.  The plot meanders through the confusion of Yugoslavia's three-way civil war  while under Italian and German occupation.  A fun adventure, a light read,  a real Alistair MacLean classic.
1220, Michael Kitchen playing Christopher Foyle is not a super slueth, he is more like the quiet, patient grandfather type.  His doggish style for solving complex mysteries is great to watch and makes him a fearsome opponent.  This English made series runs at a different pace than we are used to in the U.S., which makes it a welcome change.  My wife and I were hooked from the very first show of the first season.  Because this series lacks the excessive violence and action of most U.S. shows, I suspect this series would appeal more to the older generations.
1221, I used this bag alot and was quite rough with it, eventually the stitching starting coming apart because I would carry heavy and sharp edge objects, (books mostly) and it would jump around a lot so I stressed the straps a lot. It's lasted me a long long time and will buy another one because it's so quintessential and the canvas is good quality.On another note for those men who are concerned about being notarized as a, &#34;dude who carries a &#34;man purse&#34; I say whooooo cares! It's not like it's colored pink for goodness sake!
1222, All eight-minutes-and-four-seconds of "You And I dominate thestart of this CD even as the live "Stone City Band,Hi" intro andthe P-Funkin' "Sexy Lady" never leave that perpulsive funk territory.And of course there is the unforgettable "Mary Jane"but this album sadly succumbs to many a Motown artist's mainpitfull.In 1978 the label was known for offering up hot SINGLESon they're classic 45's then working that hard on albums.As a result 'Come Get It!' is padded down with the unabashedly discoid "Be My Lady",the cutesy and oozy balladry of "Dream Maker" and he disgustingly epic schmaltz of "Hollywood".Thankfully BAD taste (bad meaning FONKY) comes to the rescue by the end with a revisit of the intro.A classic debut overall butI must deduct one star for the horrible filler,however miniscule,there is.Otherwise enjoy!
1223, I really do like doing sudokus and this one is very nice to do.  It is a lot better than doing them in the paper.  If you put a wrong number in it will let you know,you don't have to keep erasing it out like on paper.  Their are different levels and set-ups of the game that you can play.  You can turn on and off the timer and other things in the game.  It is fun to play the game, because it really stimulates the mind and makes you think about your next move. I will and I have recommended it to a friend.  Download the game you will truly enjoy it.
1224, I have always loved sci-fi stuff but real science intimidated me a LOT. I went back to college in my 40s and found out not only did I like science I was pretty good at it. This led to an interest in shows and books I wouldn't have touched earlier. This show takes the people on the cutting edge of science and tops in their field and presents their ideas in laymen terms as much as possible. Since I am definitely a layman I appreciate this very much. I am looking forward to season 3 :-)!
1225, Amazon is the best place to buy these. They are cheap and always available, and the same quality that you get from the dealership or online suppliers. I believe they are actually SLIGHTLY cheaper on some online sites, but you have to pay shipping. Thank you Amazon!I don't know why people give this filter a bad rating when it is their own fault that they bought the wrong one. Do you homework, make sure this is the one that fits your vehicle, and you will be quite happy. There are many online resources that give the filter item number that is comparable with your car.If you get the right one, this is the only place you should get your filter.
1226, This is one of the most profound releases of all time. Not only is What's Going On a collection of some of the greatest R&B; music ever, but it is simultaneously an American history class and, over thirty years after the fact, a thorough summary of current events that tells it like it is more than any recent State of the Union address.With themes that deal with the ecology, the economy, struggling to make ends meet, and war, Marvin Gaye's lyrics in What's Going On are perhaps more relevant today than they were back during its release in 1971. Unlike so much of today's media and their commentators, Gaye got to the heart of the matter and gave insight to what is important in this country.If only America would wake up and see where things are headed. Listening to this material would be an important start, for it is no Dog and Pony show that seems so pervasive in what has seemed to become a less enlightened, less civilized culture.
1227, I love this app!  They say keeping a diary of what you eat helps keep you healthy and this is the easiest way to keep a diary.  Every food I've searched for has been found in this app.  And you can create the recipes you make on a regular basis.  They make it so easy.  The only thing I would change is the Strength portion.  I'd love to be able to add an arm workout as a whole, or a leg or ab workout.  But it's a small thing compared to the great things about this app.  It's so easy and user friendly.  And it's FREE!
1228, ES File Explorer is great, I believe one of the best out there for your Android device, but this was built for a specific revision and may not want to work on yours.  Keep searching, the latest versions are here and work fantastic.  ES goes above and beyond with copy, move, delete and more functions in a clean layout that's customizable but WORKS.  Many I tried were missing a command or required tons of clicking to get something simple done.  ES eliminated most of that stress and hasn't failed.
1229, We were originally keeping the diapers and wipes on the shelf of the changing table, probably because we didn't think there was a better option. I am so glad we found this, it works and fits perfectly for our changing table.The only issue we have now is that the wipes are accessible by the child being changed, and sometimes she likes to sit up and try to grab the pack. But if this wasn't there, I'm sure she would just find something else to do that is just as inconvenient.
1230, A truck driver passing through a small town is passed along an item that will summon a demon to kill him in a few days and as time winds down he desparately tries to find a way to avoid this fate.Muriel Grey takes her time establishing her main character Josh but when the story kicks into a nightmarish race against time it's scary fun.Racing along highways trying to find a solution this has the riveting intensity that's been missing from Dean Koontz and Stephen King books in years.Keeping the mumbo jumbo to a minimum and the tension high with a likable main character this is one of the best horror novels of recent years.
1231, The silver on these is not a woven Celtic silver knot. The silver is die cut, thin, almost foil thin. The silver is poorly worked to make it look as though it is a knot, but there are many rough spots. the welding of the know to the stone setting is uneven.  And caution, because it doesn't jump out at you from the product description, the stones are synthetic.The metal is stamped 925 (for sterling, but the workmanship is so bad I question whether this stamp is accurate). The ear wires are also stamped 925.Product is labeled "Made in Thailand."
1232, I was so happy when my Yaktrax walker traction device came in the mail today, I immediately put them on (carefully) to run some errands, it's pretty icy here in Maine. Within 5 minutes, both of them had slipped off and I lost one. I was pretty happy with the Yaktrax Pro Ice Walkers that I used last winter but they were hard to put on. These  lighter Traction Device Walkers were much easier to put on and clearly easy to remove, much too easy! I can't even return them as I now only have one. I am going back to the Pro Ice Walkers, the velcro trap keeps them on my shoes where they belong. I do not recommend these lighter weight ones without the strap, they sure didn't last long!
1233, First one or two episodes were sort of interesting, but then, the sillies set in. If paranoia is your thing, then you will love this. The usual liberal plot of big bad greedy guys who control world events to make themselves richer. Of course the biggest bad guy is X CIA, who else? The &#34;good guy&#34;, also X CIA, is gay (is that saying something about the writers?). The amount of surveillance portrayed would require an army of people to monitor and maintain all the bugs. Any intelligence agency would love to have the super small devices shown, that somehow seem to function without any visible power source.  All in all, very stupid. Hope I don't get a four leaf clover in the mail over this.
1234, This is a very useful little app, but I do have  major beef with it. While the app will subtract calories burned during cardio it does NOT do so for strength training which only serves to proliferate the myth that in order to be skinny you should be doing hours of cardio. LOOK AROUND THE GYM, LADIES...THE HOTTEST BODIES ARE NOT SLUMPING THRU 10 MILES ON THE TREADMILL. THEY ARE LIFTING WEIGHTS. HEAVY WEIGHTS. YOU LACK THE TESTOSTERONE TO &quot;BULK UP&quot; LIKE A MAN. THAT IS ONE OF THE MOST DAMAGING MYTHS IN FITNESS HISTORY! not only do you burn just as many calories while lifting but UNLIKE cardio, you continue burning at a higher rate for the rest of the day. And too much cardio? yeah...that actually will stop your thyroid from producing T3....which will effectively shut down your metabolism. dont believe me? Google it.
1235, This show was based on TRUE methods of determining/detecting the veracity of a spoken statement - micro-muscle twitches, raised eyebrows, etc.  It was fascinating to watch "the team" read the lies on people's faces.  It was well-written and acted.  I can only believe that those who did not want to have it continue on the air are those who regularly lie and did not want to teach others how to catch them.  I am thrilled to have the series forever, even though I would love to see more episodes.
1236, I purchased a New Trent iTorch IMP52D 5200mAh External Battery Charger that I use with my iPhone 5.I really like the iTorch. I would rate it overall 5/5. The pro's are it's convenient, portable, consistent with its charging. I love that it fits in a coat pocket. I don't use the flashlight much I use my iphone for that. The LED I use to play with my cats-they give it a 5/5.The cons---the charging cable to charge it. It feels flimsy but is still holding up after at least 30 uses and shows no sign of wear.A specific iPhone/charging cable would be nice
1237, This was too big for our two month old and he was very uncomfortable. His neck is still unstable so I had to hold his neck the entire time while taking a bath rather than it whacking on the hard plastic. Also the protruding centerpiece is a good place to crush a baby's balls so watch out especially if he's too small to fit in the tub properly! I think this tub would be good for older infants or toddlers but not for our two month old. Hopefully in the future we can use it again.
1238, An outstanding novel.  One hundred people are selected to go and establish a colony on Mars, and it looks at the physical, intellectual and psychological testing that is undergone to get into that group.The main part of the book though is the travel and establishment of a base on Mars, and the relationships and conflicts that develop, particularly among the leaders of the group.Research discovers a longevity treatment, and this has serious side effects on an Earth in crisis.  Political factions develop on Mars on the best way to develop or not develop the planet, and whether to take any crap from the growing influence of Earth corporate power.
1239, I am not sure how somebody can screw up a simple audio cable extender cable, but these guys have done it. It is impossible to create a solid connection both inside the iPhone and when connecting the headphone jack. Once everything is snuggly plugged in, the slightest rotation/jerk of the cable in the iphone produces hiss and loss of contact. Same goes for the headphone jack. It's like these things are made not to maintain a continuous contact where they're supposed to have a contact. Avoid at all costs.
1240, These things are easy to use and seem to do a very good job of securing the trailer but you do need to make sure you get the right ones for the distance between the wheels as this does vary between campers. i forgot to take these out before attempting to leave the campsite and they held tight enough that the wheels skidded rather than turning so I know they are effective. Thankfully we only moved a few inches but it was a good, although inadvertent, test of their effectiveness. Much better than carrying blocks of wood or the plastic wedges.
1241, This is an awesome app and by far the most User friendly of the calorie counter apps I've found for my kindle.  I'll be honest I have downloaded everyone offered and tried them all in a search for one that's both useful and easy and this one wins hands down.  It 's just so much easier than most of them out there and it has so many more capabilities than most of them.  It helps me stay on track for both eating and exercise.  I couldn't ask for more and I highly recommend it!
1242, Yes,this is a funky album featuring two Top 10 hits,BRICK HOUSE and EASY. It was 1977 and disco was very much dominating the music world even with some white artists like The Bee Gees and K.C. & The Sunshine Band. Lionel Richie,the Commodores' staple member brings fans the nice,subtle piece EASY(for those who can't stand funk will like that track). BH really rocks,funkily. BH is a popular favorite amongst many infamous cover bands,whether their forte(s) is/are pop,rock or soul(those categories inarguably describe the style of Daryl Hall and John Oates). The Commodores put out four more albums following this one and Richie would then leave for a successful solo career(his first three solo releases were best-selling megahits). The Commodores carried on for a few years without Richie,possibly with a replacement for him. Fans of the Commodores are also fans of The Gap Band,Kool & The Gang,Ray Parker Jr. & Raydio and Chic.
1243, I use these for everyday use around the house or office and generally when traveling or mowing the lawn. They have been fantastic for 11 months until I began to wear them while exercising 3 weeks ago and found that despite their claim of being moisture and sweat resistant they don't appear the be able to handle sweat much at all. My head and neck get damp during exercise (not dripping) and it somehow seeped into the controls and the vol down and rewind buttons stopped working. Also while exercising the headphones initiated a phone call on my cell phone (there is a button on them for that).Before this problem they were fantastic. Bottom line, wearing them while working out probably isn't a good idea but for everyday use they are champs, They take a lot of abuse and keep on going but they seem deathly afraid of sweat :)
1244, This little App is perfect for automatically keeping track of all my banking on my Kindle Fire HD.  I just fill in the necessary data that I ordinarily use to sign-in on my PC and it goes straight from my home Wi-fi to my bank accounts (checking, savings, credit card, and personal loan), and updates it all - really fast. It did this the first time as soon as I filled-in my password.  So far I have found no glitches.  No mess, no fuss, no bother - and I can look at it in detail at my convenience, and even quickly update it 24/7.  They really should charge something.
1245, Our 6 month old outgrew her 4 stage bath tub & I wasn't comfortable readjusting it to fit a toddler.  This Eurobath is wonderful.  It is VERY roomy & baby enjoys splashing around. There is plenty of room for her toys.  It has a drain & I haven't had any problems with it.  It seems like it would have been perfect to bathe an infant too (since it has the special design to do so), but I didn't have it at the time.  I definitely recommend this tub!
1246, Not even close.  I bought the series based on the Nebula and Hugo Awards.  What a HUGE mistake....and I will never trust those particular award juries again.  This guy does not have much to say, but says it repeatedly, exhaustively, and ad nauseum.  The characters are exclusively two dimensional, all lacking passion and driven by inexplicable logic to actions that make little sense.  The extensive descriptive narrative is mind numbing and filled with geological jargon.  You spend most of the book wading through this blah blah blah, and when something finally does happen, it is disappointinly anti-climactic.  I will never buy another piece of literature by this author.
1247, I'm starting school at Berkeley this fall. I have iPhone 4 which I use A LOT in college. However, it's impossible to charge my iPhone on campus. So I bought this portable battery. Then my phone last all day long!!! From 8:00am to 7:00pm, still have 60%. And the iTorch? I just use it to charge my phone for 30mins. It stills shows a full battery. I charge this iTorch once a week or every two weeks. It really holds a lot of juice.PROS:Stylish outfit, with a LED light built-in, which can function as a flashlight. Can charge iPad& Galaxy Tab, they need a higher current which other brands doesn't have.CONS:The laser pointer can be activated by accident (only 1-click of a button) and shoot the laser into eyes. But I never accidentally activated the laser pointer....Need to add an extra adapter cable before charging galaxy tab.Does not come with a wall charger.
1248, This is definitely art in moving form.Mesmerizing.Capturing The Beatles during their very brilliant psychedelic period. This dvd is great for anyone who wasn't born, can't remember or wants to take a journey back in time.Though not a Beatles fanatic,I can't resist taking refreshing glance backward to a strange but wonderful place in time.'I am The Walrus'  played out by the band in beautiful,colorful clothes and egg costumes is spliced and put together in a psychedelic collage that's a masterpiece.This in itself is a reason to get this dvd.The whole film is spectacular.Highly recommended.
1249, Does what an oil filter should for a good price. I trust Bosch, as I have owned Bosch power tools for decades and always have been pleased with their quality of function and longevity. I have a Bosch corded drill that is 40 years old and works like new. Can't get the power of line electricity in a battery drill, so you will always need a corded drill on hand to do the job when your lithium can't.  Bosch and Makita are the only brands I buy in tools. The best.
1250, We bought a house that for all the other dumb stuff the sellers were asked to do after our inspection both personal and VA, they didn't have issue with the openings between the rails on the stairway. My older daughter could not just fit her head through but her whole body with no effort!  They are the typical late sixties rails and are metal. Before you scoff and say how you would just replace them with code wooden ones I implore you to look up the cost of a single family home in the DC Metro area of Potomac and you will likely gulp as you swallow your words!  So this netting is a much more viable and affordable option. Easy to install and very sturdy if you attach it properly. Once my girls are old enough I will get rid of the netting and gates and maybe even reclaim the living room as an adult room. Until then this item is a great purchase to keep children safe.
1251, I thought I need to change the nipples since my baby is already 100 days old :P. But after trying size 3 for four times, I'm certain that this size is too big for him. Yes, he drinks really really fast by using size 3, but he dripped three times more than when he's using size 2 nipples. So I switched back to size 2 for now. Don't get me wrong, I like Avent nipples and I'm sure size 3 will work just as well as size 2 in the future, but perhaps it shouldn't be labeled as 3 mo+.....
1252, Mrs. Meyers Geranium Dish soap has a very nice fragrance. Anything that makes cleaning more enjoyable is worth a lot to me. I have not found another product for dishes that does such a good job. I like that a little of it goes a long way and that it's a environmentally friendly product. Ordering from Amazon, by the case of 6 is convenient, a good deal and I don't have to worry about buying dish soap for a long time. This soap seems to last a lot longer than other brands.I've also used the Geranium kitchen cleanser by Mrs. Meyers which smells great and is good for getting rid of ants. I just sprinkle it around my window sills and the ants won't cross the line. It must be the fragrance.
1253, Great quality-make and not astro-turf. Thin and easily installed. Good grip to step and shoes. It is not a long pile so will not hold a lot of dirt. I recommend a carpet or rug on the ground to wipe feet on. This goes on a Jayco Greyhawk motorhome with a power step, and uses 4 hooked-springs in grommets. Be very careful hooking this type or you can impale your fingers with a sharp spring-end, even if you use gloves. Use leather or a solid type of glove material that cannot be penetrated by the needle-sharp spring-end. There is one step-cover type that uses ties but has bad reviews as the ties can break during travel-probably unlikely but time can make ties brittle. The only con with is it could be a little longer as the lower step shows the grommets.
1254, I bought this together with a thumb sucking guard. Let's just say that the combination worked wonders on my 3 year old!He's no longer sucking his thumb. He did throw up twice and he is a picky eater so I wasn't so happy about it. But I'd rather he lost appetite for a couple of days than having him suck on his thumb on his wedding night! jajaja!Anyhow, I have a lot of this remaining so I will give it to another child sufferer.It does work wonders for kids.
1255, &#34;You do know the man is nitroglycerin,&#34; warns a colleague about John Luther.  This detective in London, Luther, is played by Idris Elba. Most notably know from the series 'The Wire'. Luther is a different man, volatile, crazy, and engrossed in his job. We meet him as he is chasing a very bad man. Something awful course and the next time we see him seven months has gone, and his career and marriage in shambles.Back he comes on the job,  fragile in some ways, but Luther becomes involved in a weird murder case where he meets a crazy and possible killer Alice Morgan, played by Ruth Wilson. he has met his match. Alice can see Luther has a troubled mind. One grisly murder after another occurs, and they all lead to Alice. The cases get more disturbing until the final two episodes where things start to boil over.Luther becomes addictive, so watch it!Recommended. prisrob 09-16-13
1256, This is a great, amazing bag and sturdy, comfy, everything. The only problem with it is that it faded pretty quickly. I don't take it in the sun ever, not at all, but it did fade a lot. I don't know why. Anyway, this faded look would be just fine if I were a guy and could hang with a more rugged look, but I'm a female teacher and kind of think it looks grungy. I like the bag though and still use it sometimes.
1257, After watching the first season I decided to see if the second season would be better. I was disappointed to find that it was just more of the same with the exception of adding a &#34;love&#34; interest, a member of the FBI, for Carter that just added  more sex into the fray. Story lines were the same. I can understand why it only lasted two seasons. However, if you like cop shows with sex, drugs and no &#34;rock and roll&#34; then watch Dark Blue.
1258, This was and still is an astounding confounding compounding  tribute to music!  If I have to break it down for you track by track or CD 1 and 2...then you've been asleep for the past 20+ years and really should run out and get this CD because you are wayyyyyyyyy behind!  Run, don't walk!AS...was and still is one of the baddest jams ever from any artist past, present and throw in the the future too!!  Listen to the words, not just the beat!
1259, I like this game-yet it seems lacking to me. I would like to see more of a range offered for betting...can you tell yet that I'm conservative and would rather stick with a boring bet of $10 a hand versus a jump up to $50 a hand?! A good waste of time though - and the price was right. Too long to wait for more free betting money*and yet I refuse to pay to play. Buying that Angry Bird eagle twice for one game was enough for me!!!
1260, Have been able to fully recharge my phone (HTC T-bolt) at least twice without having to recharge the New Trent, will probably come close or succeed at 3 recharges.  I would have preferred that the New Trent recharged itself from the USB connector rather than the round plug on the side but the self coiling connector cable  plus mini and micro tips work okay.  Also comes with a small pouch to store everything in.  About the size of a  pack of cigarettes but half as thick or less makes it easy enough to carry around.  So far so good. Seems to be a good value. No power supply provided so must recharge from a PC or charger with USB outlet, not a big deal for me and helps hold the cost down.
1261, It amazes me that the themes and sentiments that Marvin Gaye expressed in 1972 are still so contentious and relevant in the age of this 'new millenium'.  Racism, taxes, war, poverty, jobs, pollution, drug usage, etc...  And in the 30 years since it was originally released it would appear that very little has changed.This album is more like a collection of related short stories than a musical work.  It always amazes me how smoothly the transitions occur between songs that have different themes, tempos, and sentiments.  You're totally unaware of when one song ends and another begins.The instruments range from bongos to violins.  And all are seemlessly interwoven to paint the pictures of desperation, pain, disbelief, confusion, outrage, friendship, love, and mercy.This would probably be one of the 5 albums that I would want to take to a deserted island if I had to go.
1262, I love this product!! It makes a huge difference in how the changing room smells. I have seen negative reviews on this product, but I would guess that they haven't mastered how to use it. It is a little tricky. It would be nice if it held a few more diapers, and the cutting and changing of the refills is a little tricky, but I love it just the same. The sausage idea is great because it contains the smell when you open it to put another diaper in there. My 5 mo old laughs everytime she sees her father change it. He loves to go on about the poo-poo sausages that she is so talented at making...lol (Daddies are weird) When you get one make sure you read the directions twice
1263, This does not work with a RedEye Mini infrared adapter.I bought this to use with a RedEye infrared adapter on my iPhone 3GS (RedEye mini Plug-in Universal Remote Adapter for iPhone, iPod touch and iPad) which is in an Otterbox Defender case (OtterBox Defender Case for iPhone 3G, 3GS (Black)[Retail Packaging]). The RedEye Mini is too fat to fit into the headphone jack slot of the Otterbox case, so I thought an adapter would be a good solution. Unfortunately, it does not work for this purpose.It does work as a headphone extender, but for that purpose, I have no use as I don't use headphones with my iPhone.I have not tested with the Square credit card reader. I will try that soon and report back.
1264, I was very disappointed with this hand soap.  The bottle is really ugly (not great in a guest bathroom) and after a few weeks I couldn't wait to be finished with all of the bottles so that I could replace them with the better designed Method hand soap bottles.I also didn't like how watery the liquid soap was.  We ended up using more soap so even though a bottle was cheaper than other liquid hand soaps it lasted half as long.The scent was so faint you basically won't be able to smell it.Because of the ugly bottle packaging, watery consistency, and lack of aromatic scent I will not be purchasing this bottle again.
1265, I was pleasantly surprised at the appearance of this shirt when I got it. Many of these cheaper solid colored shirts are really very solid colored and don't look natural. This one has some grays and whites mixed in which makes a good looking casual shirt. I am also happy with the length. I ordered a few other 2XL and 3XL shirts and many of them were much longer than expected. This one is the right length to wear on a 6'1&#34; frame without having to tuck it in.The only negative I have to say about it is that the tag is a little itchy.
1266, I must agree with the previous comments.  It is a shame that the picture quality on this dvd has not been improved. It does look like a clean vhs transfer. The story about old footage is absurd. Today with modern techniques the footage could have been surely improved. There are dvds with older, more primitive video and they look better than this one. See Led Zeppelin dvd and Majicat from Cat Stevens for example. And in the case of Majicat, you have extra footage where you can see the difference between the raw and finished footage quality.It has to be said that the sound upgrade is tremendous. And the documentary is a nice treat too. I'm not sure but I believe that there is footage of Lady Writer from this gig too, but not sure.
1267, RE; ABRIDGED AUDIO CASSETTE VERSION. Two simulanteous capers from the same protagonist - mission impossible commando raid and avenging vigilante assassin - should not work together in a credible plot structure, but here it does.  Such is Clancy's skill as a storyteller.  Neither should the hardboiled hero's love-at-first-touch fling with a lost girl be sufficient motivation for the events that follow but, again, Clancy makes it work.  My suggestion: sit back and enjoy a master weave suspense from what should be unbelievable circumstances.  Dukes, although not my favorite reader, does good work with this one.
1268, With a bad back and knees I have been bathing my child in the kitchen sink so that I can stand up, but she was getting far too big for it. When I saw this and read the reviews we ordered it. The first night I used it was fantastic. No longer do I have to hold onto our slippery baby with one hand and wash her with the other which is uncomfortable for the both of us. She can lay back and calm down at the end of the evening whilst I wash her with both hands and not have to worry about letting her slip and I love that when she's a little bit bigger she can switch ends and sit up on her own. Brilliant. Love it.
1269, I don't know what happened with this app. It works perfectly on my cell phone, but on this Kindle Fire HD 8.9", it is horrible! I can see my pictures and all, but everything is blurry as hell & it is a difficult U.I to navigate through. Even trying to scroll through my pictures is a chore. It takes a very long time to see my pics. Even if I am right in front of the modem, it still takes too long. My Samsung Galaxy S3 is way faster at this app. I plan on getting rid of this app & just using it only on my phone & home computer.
1270, I absolutely could not put this book down! John Kelly/John Clark (Johnnie Boy!) is an awesome character that I would love to see Mr. Clancy use more often. I won't detail the plot and spoil it for you, but the way John handled the disgusting murder of his love Pam was phenomenal. I think he had the right phylosophy. A great way to clean up the neighborhoods. I enjoyed the "human" side Mr. Clancy interjected where John wasn't paying attention and got shot, and the realistic version of a mission screwed up do to a traitor (loose lips sink ships). There is another book in this storyline just waiting to be written (if not alread) as the wrong person died for ruining the mission - the traitor is still unknown to those who thought they handled the problem. If this was written already (since I'm just starting to read this author as I don't like the Splinter Cells) I wish somebody would tell me because it will proabably be a great read.
1271, I have very, VERY breakout-prone skin, and this serum has yet to cause any problems for me. It's smooth and light, and I feel like my skin has looked smoother since I've started using it. I don't think it's made much of a difference for any marks or blemishes on my skin, but the texture of my skin looks better now. With the warmer weather, I've been using it alone (without any other moisturizer) at night and it's doing a great job on its own of keeping my skin moist.
1272, I bought several of these and installed them in the rooms at our bed and breakfast. As I don't wear make up it never occurred to me that women would like to see their pores expanded to such an alarming size. In any case, the mirror has two sides, one with a normal reflection and one 5X. It is easy to flip from side to side. I wall-mounted them in a matter of minutes and they telescope out and tilt so people of varying heights can easily adjust them. Nice, clean design and good for the purpose they serve.
1273, I bought this because my older daughter had one just like it about 9 years ago. This clip is being used only when we go on car rides, so baby doesn't lose her pacifier. Well after about 4 months of occasional use the clip itself won't close all the way, so it doesn't secure to anything. Pacifier constantly falls onto the floor. Very disappointed as it's a cute design and it fit in her pacifier holder. Now its only purpose is to take up space in a landfill. Junk, do not buy!
1274, These are price friendly high-quality T-shirts that come in great colors. I use them to wear underneath collared shirts to be seen where the neck is, to add software to my already funky shirts. At the same time they keep you warm in the winter being fairly heavy. I don't understand the negative feedback from anyone, they are high quality, made well, and I have many of them. Do not hesitate, go ahead and buy them, you will not regret it. The only thing negative I can say is that the prices can be a little bit lower, and should be.
1275, Everyone knows that the key to weight loss is fewer calories in and more calories out. This app helps to quantify calories in and out. Just being aware helps me curb intake. Excellent functionality and having access on my Kindle, Droid, and  computer makes it very easy to work with. I am writing this almost a year later (1-3-14) and I have lost 30+ pounds using this program. It takes a lot of discipline to do this sort of thing and MyFitnessPro helps me find that discipline.
1276, The app I downloaded for my kindle works great! Before this I never &quot;got&quot; why this game was so popular. But seeing it was free and getting bored with my other apps I figured I'd give it a go when my friend suggested it. I am now hooked on this game Lol! This app works wonderfully on my kindle and I haven't had any issues with it. Everything about it has been very smooth, even has a tutorial for people like me who have no idea how it works. I just can't say how much I love my new game!
1277, My baby has mild eczema so I bath her with Cetaphil, followed by Aveeno bath oil, and then slather on Cetaphil cream.  The bath oil is on the runny side so it doesn't take much volume to cover her body while wet. The instructions say to lightly rinse off the excess oil after applying. I scoop water into my hand and gently pour it over her but it still feels like most of it is gone after the rinse.  I can't say I see a remarkable difference in whether I use this as part of her bath ritual or not. It certainly does not replace the need to slather on lotion after bathing. Regardless, it smells really pleasant and does seem to leave her skin a bit softer afterward so I will keep using it.
1278, after tried out 3 different tubs, i finally bought this one. i didn't want to buy this tub at the first place because it is a humongous tub. i kept trying out other tubs and kept returning them. so finally, my husband got tired of returning tubs, he picked out this one but i was still having doubt because it is so big. but, once i gave my daughter a bath in it, i knew that this is a good buy. my daughter wouldn't slip off in the tub and there is plenty of water to pour over her body and it takes less time to bath her.
1279, This novel really did not hold my interest.  It starts out with a number of seemingly unrelated incidents.  The author apparently knows where he is and when he is, but it would be nice if he would share that with his readers.  The novel then proceeds with a bunch of parallel plots, jumping continually from one to another.  That is compounded by the author occasionally telling you how to build a watch when you just wanted to know the time.  Do we really need a manual on building sound suppressors for handguns?The various plots eventually start to come together but, by that time, I was losing interest and skimming over substantial amounts of material trying to get on with the story.  I regret that I followed the advise of the majority of reviewers, who rated it with four and five stars, and purchased the novel.  It is a skimmer rather than a page-turner, and it is not on my listing of recommended novels for other readers.
1280, This is easily Pac's best album. From "Ambitionz az a Ridah" to "California Love", Pac is bangin'. The highlight songs are "2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted", I ain't mad Acha" and "Can't C Me".All Eyez on me was produced by Suge Knight, one of the best hip hop producers ever. Personally, I think he killed Pac but thats a different story. There were guest producers such as Daz and Dr. Dre.2pac was straight outta jail on bail by Suge and Death Row Records.  That definatly affects his music and you can tell. He is acting like a star instead of a hungry kid. Like in "Can't C Me". Of course, there are positive songs like "Life Goes On" and "Shorty Wanna Be a Thug"I reccomend this to everyone. Go and buy it!
1281, The iTorch is a great external battery. After initially charging it, I usedit to quickly top off my Galaxy s III battery and had some juice left tocharge my i-pad. The I-pad really uses a lot of battery and seems to have alarge capacity so the iTorch is not enough for a complete charge. Perhaps25%. But that is plenty of time to complete a book or magazine over quite afew hours. I also enjoyed the additional mini features on the iTorch. Thelazer pointer and flashlight may come in handy. The small size of theiTorch means you can actually use these two features without the clunkyfeel of other external batteries. The iTorch charge is relatively fast,just a few hours. Many people may be upset that it does not come with it'sown AC plug, but in this day with so many electronics with USB ports, Iappreciate not having one more plug to fill up my house and eventually alandfill with.Great product and I think it's worth the purchase.
1282, I loved this film of Prince Igor!  The singing was superb, authentically Russian, and enthusiastic.  It was especially exciting to see the original choreography of Michel Fokine.  This Soviet opera film is highly entertaining, the dancing is excellent, and the actors seem to be having a great time.  So enjoy, and don't take it all too seriously.  After all, it's Prince Igor, not Die Gotterdammerung or some other monumental work.  Borodin's life long project turned into an enjoyable film.
1283, As the designated dishwasher in my household (I suppose that this is because no one has the mental or physical capacity to pour soap on a sponge and rub the dish and rinse it...I guess you can say I'm a bit hostile about that.) my hands go through a lot.  I've used several different lotions, creams, special soaps etc. to help keep my hands from drying out, but they either don't work or the products are too greasy feeling.  Not Udderly Smooth.  Udderly Smooth is perfect for my hands.  The scent is not over powering and a little goes a long way.  Also, it soaks in quickly and does not leave your hands with that gross, greasy feeling.  An extra perk, the price.  The quality of Udderly Smooth is amazing compared to other lotions I've paid $15 for...you just can't beat it! If you have dishpan hands, this is for you!
1284, I was a little skeptical after the fist season ended since Christopher Eccleston was no longer going to be The Doctor.  I really loved him.  But, since I had become a fan of the series, I decided to give the 2nd season a try, starting with the Christmas episode...David Tennant's first episode.I am so glad I gave it a try!  David Tennant's interpretation of the 10th Doctor is superb.  He is great fun to watch.  If you are not sure about this season, give this episode a try ... you won't be sorry!
1285, Red Mars started off just dandy, with a variety of characters (a bit too one-dimensional, but hey) struggling with how to best colonize Mars.  No one was a 'good' guy or a 'bad' guy - just good hard sci-fi mixed with honest ideological differences.Halfway through the book, however, it all changed.  All of a sudden, Trans-national corporations are launching nukes, after buying out the United Nations.  Christian fundamentalists try to dominate the colonies.  A few hundred scientists on Mars discover wildly optimistic technologies, while the billions of people on Earth decend into chaos, primarily because of those darn evil trans-nationals.What started out as a balanced and interesting book jumped clear off the left end.  I'll only read the sequels because I want to read all the Hugo and Nebula award winners - not because I have any hope for the rest of the series.
1286, The camera on the Kindle Fire HD does actually work, and you can use it to take pictures, but you cannot open it without getting to it.For some reason, the Kindle is blocked from seeing things that are available on the device, but this software app allows you to go in and activate the camera so that you can use it.You can record video, stills and even a panorama view, which takes a little practice.Without this app (or one like it) I would not be able to use the camera on the Kindle.
1287, Knock on wood - been working in my Lexus RX300 for about 2 months.  Look around, but I couldn't find a better price than these guys.  It's also a true Denso, not a knock-off.  Autozone had the same unit for about 2x the price.  Dealer was even more.  Shipping is a bit slow, but nothing to get all ruffled about.  Maybe 5-6 days or so.  Replaced the sensor, reset the lights with a scanner and viola - all lights out and stayed out.  I think lights will go out by themselves anyway after 3 cold starts
1288, When Tex Avery departed Warner's "Termite Terrace" for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1942, the animator's wild imagination was given free reign - bolstered by the studio's high production values. This out-of-print video includes eight Avery gems for a glorious hour of cartoon madness. "Who Killed Who?" (1943), "Lucky Ducky" (1948), "Bad Luck Blackie" (1949) and the influential "Magical Maestro" (1952) represent Tex at the peak of his frenzied powers. Though Avery's entire MGM work was released on laserdisc in 1993, it remains criminally unavailable on DVD.
1289, I do like that I can recharge my phone up all the way with this unit.Being a geek I don't read the directions, keep that in mind, I'd much rather explore than read.Getting use to how the &#34;power on/off/laser/LED Flashlight&#34; button is a trick for me.This button dose work and has a nice subdued snap feel.Hold the button down for a second or two to do one thing, just press it quick and it turns on something else.Me I'd like a little thing like this to have more switches, BUT that is just me.I might get more than two, I want to have one in my bag to just to give to someone in need of power....I might get one or two more as my need for power goes up, yes I might get power hungry!
1290, Simply beautiful and classy. For me, by the time the &#34;classic 5 period&#34; was over, David Ruffin departed, Eddie Kendricks departed, Paul Williams transitioned, Dennis Edwards departed and Melvin Franklin transitioned, they were NOT The Temptations. Still, this is a gorgeous album, lush and romantic. A companion to &#34;In a Mellow Mood &#34; possibly even better. Richard Perry does a splendid job similar too his work with Diana, &#34;Baby It's Me&#34;.&#34;I'm Glad There is You&#34; and &#34;Night & Day&#34; steal the show.I have no connection to the group members, but, these guys CAN sing.Wikipedia incorrectly identifies it as &#34;the longest running album in their career&#34; clumsily confusing it with &#34;In a Mellow Mood&#34; and even states it sold 3 million despite peaking at #43 on the R&B; album chart.Those silly errors don't dampened their enjoyment.
1291, The demos are hard to follow and I had to go to a special webiste to learn how to play. Once I learned I became addicted to it. The free version has a maximum of 60 moves on the biggest level. Not much of a factor for me as the first two are challenging  enough. Great game!Basically, like Reversi you take turns placing black and white pieces. Your motive is to trap your opponent and when the modt space of the board. If you fully surround the the players pieces they are removed from the bosrd but I have found that in cases is best to leave the slot empty if it guarantees that they cannot in turn come and reclaim the section.Also, it's a very good idea to create as many "eyes" as possible making it impossible for them to place in the slot inside the eye. (The rules explain better than I can on this point.)All in all it's a very good game for those who like strategic games.
1292, This application is not only great because of it's networking abilities but it also helps by TELLING YOU how many calories are found in the foods you're eating!  You will realize serving sizes & start eating healthier, just because of this app! The information you receive helps you to be a better you! I've already lost 6 lbs. in less than a month & I thank this app for helping to make me aware of my caloric intake!! A little exercise & MY FITNESS PAL encouragement from your friends, goes a LONG WAY!!!!
1293, I've always wanted to play Go and so had a few times on Yahoo Messenger's games well I stunk at it so when seen it for Kindle Fire I was thinking "alright I'll try my luck." and I still stink. XD  I can at least capture some of the computers pieces but I am terrible at it still. It's more simple than chess yet I stink at the surrounding the opponent pieces. Would be good if I could remember how to do that. If someone is into thinking and planning moves several steps ahead to place pieces down to block and surround their opponent first then this is for them. If its someone who likes strategy games and doesn't care if win or lose then can also do this. I still enjoy it though I lose every time. One day I'll figure that sucker out and I won't lose all the time....maybe just part of the time. hehe -laughs rubbing back of head-
1294, Its great, it fits so many items, i fit like 15-18 size 1 diapers, wipes, bottle of cream, tube of diaper cream, lots of small staff (hair brush, cotton swabs, nail clippers, alcohol pads, etc.) it very easy to put it together, i never had a problems with it falling down or falling apart. Plastic is very thick and seems sturdy. Well  this huge plastic thing doesnt look very attractive, but it super useful and clear, so u dont see it right away in the room.
1295, The problem with finding suitable spark plugs for your vehicle is that other than the OEM that comes with your car, the quest is trial and error,  some may say they're the best, then you put them in your car and they don't do their job... so it's all trial and error, once you find the ones that work, stick to those.some tips i can give are the following... search on the web for previous owner experiences to make a big picture of what you ought to be looking for; ALWAYS gap the plugs as specified in your car manual or the suggested gap by the spark plug brand for your car;  use correct and equal torque when installing all plugs on all cylinder heads.Ive heard a rule ... if your car is jap, buy jap plugs (denso, ngk) if your car is american, buy american (champion, autolite), if your car is euro, buy euro plugs (bosch)NGK iridium are great buy, excellent quality and performance and fairly priced.
1296, For 5$, these are definitely a good purchase. The shades came quickly, and though they weren't super high quality, they were nice for sure. They mirror nicely so that you can't see behind the shades from the outside, but please keep in mind this makes them a lot darker to see out of than normal sunglasses. The metal has a little bit of give to it so you can bend it a little, but the free pouch is really nice to protect the shades from scratches. Overall good purchase.
1297, I've always wanted a pair of these for when I'm doing woodworking in the garage. They don't tend to show up in stores, and I prefer to shop on Amazon, so I ordered a pair. I ordered 34W X 32L, my regular pants size.  Although my pants tend to be a bit on the loose side, these are a bit on the tight side, but I suppose they will stretch out a bit.  If I were to get another pair, I'd go for 36 waist, although these are perfectly useable.They are comfortable, have lots of pockets, and are perfect for working on a project, with a place for lots of small items.  Dickies makes a good product, so I'm sure they'll last for years.
1298, the title does not fit the movie at all- the movie moves so s-l-o-w due to the directors ambitious drive to focus on details- details that bring absolutely contribute nothing to the plot. That being said- the movie actually has stunning, "award worthy" cinematography (even though I was unaware of any pyramids on the Mexican / US border)still- the acting was above average and the actors / actresses were believable- and very realistic; the scenes of south america kept me interested even when the plot didn't. Only problem was, you never really believed these aliens were "monsters."this movie was basically a mash-up of "war or the worlds" and "clover field" except with land roaming octopus instead of high-tech machines or some lizard creature. The lack of imagination regarding the "monsters" was disappointing. But- it was worth the watch, especially if you have a little time to kill at an airport like I did...
1299, This concert movie featuring Pink Floyd during their 1987-88 world tour in support of A Momentary Lapse Of Reason never ceases to delight both the ear and the eye.  The video is actually better than the audio release.  It was filmed on location at Nassau Coliseum in Uniondale, New York from August 19-23, 1988.  Everything you'd expect from a Pink Floyd concert is captured right here from flying pigs to brilliant lights to colorful animation.  David Gilmour and company seem to be having the time of their lives and why not!  They are finally free from the dictatorial grasp of Roger Waters who previously controlled the songwriting and direction of the group.  They can now express their musical ideas in their own way.  If you've never seen Pink Floyd in concert before, buy this video today and enjoy!  You won't regret it.
1300, I bought this after I moved into an apt with a mirror that was pretty far from the sink and did not fold out. I would have to lean really close to the mirror to make sure I didn't miss a spot shaving.The mirror was easy to install and shouldn't leave to much damage. (usual screw holes). Used a low power drill.The arm for the mirror is sturdy and easily folds in and out and stays in place.Both mirrors work well. The magnifiedmirror is perfect.Only negative I have come across is that, like almost any mirror, it doesn't clean that well. Windex eventually does the job, but does seem a little tougher than usual.
1301, Well, am baffled that there was not a second season... Granted we do get a grip on who is pulling the strings and about who truly is initiating and benefiting from 'terrorism' .... Still, there was still much thread to unravel... and the season could have added more twists and turns... I mean come on the world is such a mess today that all you need for a good story is a pen and a blank page....  argh too close to the vest perhaps (?) for some naive souls who rather watch desperate housewives.... than 'live' an intense questioning of what is government today, or who is truly in charge 'out there'....  It is an unusual directing style, slow yet gripping.. Argh, those were the days when writing, acting and directing meant something.... Helas!
1302, This book does not deviate from the formula that has made Clancy a successful writer.  There are actually two or three plot lines going on at once, that all tie together in the end.  The downside of this method is the same in this book as it is in his others as well.  Interesting beginning, followed by several hundred pages of less than interesting material, followed by an exciting finish.  It works well in some cases, however this book seemed to lack the suspense that his other novels have.  There were a few twists and turns at the end, but nothing too surprising.My other criticism of Clancy's book is the same as my other reviews.  Too much profanity and the repeated use of violent rape scenes to move the plot along.  That's not entertaining to me.  If it wasn't for the fact that I already have his books sitting on my bookshelf, I wouldn't be reading any more Tom Clancy.
1303, Originally released in 1983, this is a 90-minute video of a show that was recorded live at the Pacific Amphitheatre in Los Angeles. The full track listing is Macarthur Park, Love Is In Control, Unconditional Love (with Musical Youth), Romeo, Don't Cry For Me Argentina, On The Radio, Woman, One Night Only, Stop In The Name Of Love, a medley of (a) Dim All The Lights (b) Sunset People (c) Bad Girls (d) Hot Stuff, followed by Last Dance, She Works Hard For The Money, State Of Independence. This is very much the post-disco Donna, the pop singer and chanteuse, as attested by the absence of her earlier disco hits like I Feel Love. Donna maintains the interest throughout and it must have been a memorable concert.
1304, Having been an Easy Spirit fan for many years, I'm always looking for less-than-full price shoes.  These "Motion" have been a consistently good buy, a great value shoe that holds up well, comfortable, polishes like new, and never separates at the seams.  I wear the newest ones for outings, the older ones for around the house, the oldest ones for the garden.  But I always watch for when they go for less than full price....because I know I will get great, consistent shoes.
1305, I have several Classic cars, a motorcycle battery, and two boat batteries that I need to keep charged, so I purchased the Battery Tender 4-Bank Battery Management System to help me keep the batteries at the optimum charge level over long periods of non-use.I have had several batteries go bad from overcharging on regular battery chargers, and from sulphating when not using or charging them for extended periods.  I decided to get the Deltran 4-Bank system to extend the useful life of my batteries  and hopefully, it will pay for itself in prolonged battery life for all of my different battery applications.
1306, My Cherie Amour is another solid late 60's album from Stevie Wonder.  The title cut is one of the best ballads he's ever done.  It has lush orchestration and a supple vocal.  Many of the other songs are in this vein including &quot;Hello Young Lovers&quot;, &quot;You &amp; Me&quot;, &quot;Somebody Knows, Somebody Cares&quot; and &quot;At Last&quot;.  &quot;Yester-Me, Yester-You, Yesterday&quot; has a great vocal and &quot;Light My Fire&quot; is based on the Jose Feliciano version not The Doors'.
1307, These are low cost shirts and are great for tall people. I am 6'4" and if anything they are too long, however my wife says I am just not used to buying shirts that fit.A few notes, these shirts do have tags (which is why it gets 4 stars), which is anoying, but I was able to rip them out without putting a while in the shirt. They are also just a little small in size, but I have an athletic build and they did fit me.UpdateAfter wearing these for several months the tan color shirts have faded and one of them fadded within 2 washes. I would avoid those. I have since worn The dark blue and black for several months and they are are fine.
1308, I've used and tried many modern waxes for my cars - some are good some are so-so and some are disappointed.I still remember the old ads of the Nu Finish Car Polish - oldest one was made in very early 70's, and the old product image of the Nu Finish Car Polish has been the main reason why I didn't buy and try it.Finally I bought it at a local store last week thanks to its cheap price and applied it to my white Mercedes-Benz. Right after applying and buffing, honestly I could not detect any difference. Next day, however, both I and my wife definitely can feel the difference at the same time when we opened the garage - more shiny and more butter like slippery than any other modern waxes!Now I clearly know why the most reviewers have given excellent scores to this magic polish.The Nu Finish Car Polish is a true Oldies But Goodies!
1309, I have to agree with one of the earlier reviewers:  the complete "videos" on this tape are fantastic, but the narrated voice-over (delivered in a near-monotone) during the opening bits isn't of much use.  Still, I use portions of this tape in my Jazz History class, and at least the narration backs up the info that students are given in their textbooks.  In all, I like certain clips in here better than the Burns "Jazz" anthology simply because they ARE complete.
1310, This is my third bluetooth voice device and I have to say that I've yet to experience a product that worked as advertised.Forget the claims companies make about reception distance.  The 220 is no exception.  On my Blackberry I've found that anything over 5 to 7 feet creates far too much annoying static.  Unlike the other bluetooth devices I've used, I've actually encountered static with the 220 even when I'm 1 foot from the phone.  However, I will say this - this is the most stable device I've used so far.  Once it partners with the phone it remains connected.So it's been a mixed bag.  I'll use the 220 until it breaks or is lost (and that always seems to happen).  After that I certainly won't be looking to buy another of the same model.
1311, This style runs on the large side. I have size 12M feet but all of the western boots that I tried in that size were too big. I finally tried this Heritage boot in black in an 11M and the fit is perfect. They have a slim look to them so it does not look like I am wearing men's boots. I wanted these for yard work but I seem to be using them to go to work in. They are very comfortable! They fit snug at first but after that they conform to you feet. Very easy to walk in, do not put pressure on the ball of your foot. I would buy these again, and probably will, just don't tell my husband.
1312, The Camco RV Wheel Stop was a good solution for us.  We were interested in stabilizing the camper while parked.  This approach of locking the tandem wheels together has the added benefit of allowing us to elevate one side of the camper on blocks (to level it out) and still be able to chalk it.  Here are some "got-cha's" though;Be sure to purchase the appropriate size to accomodate the distance between your tires.There is no 'lockable' versions of the wheel stop that I could find, even though there are retailers that advertize it as having that feature.Consider purchasing one for each side to increase the stabilization, if you are using it on a camper.Retighten it a couple of days after you've set up camp.All-in-all a good example of ingenuity.
1313, Most of you probably know the general details of the plot and the circumstances of this made-for-TV movie by the Beatles, so I'll stick to a review of the DVD itself. The b/w newsreels (Beatles opening their Apple Boutique, Beatles at Rishikesh) are interesting, some promos for the other Beatles-related films are OK, but I was not prepared for the really dismal quality of the film itself. A colorful (psychedelic, at that) film is now flat and washed out, the print itself speckled and grainy. This film cries out for restoration! An enjoyable film for Beatles fans (great proto-music videos), but if you have the VHS version, you don't need to spring for the DVD until a new edition (hopefully) gets released.
1314, Our son has bad congestion and it takes a lot of work for him to eat. Switching up to a level 3 has been great for him in terms of being able to take in more forumla.  He was eating anywhere from 30 to 120 cc before, now he is eating 150+ because he isn't expending all his energy trying to breathe and suck at the same time.  It's also cut down on the amount of time it takes to feed him.  Have not noticed more spit up or gas with the level 3 compared with the level 1.  Wish I had started using these earlier but all the nurses and doctors recommended using the Preemie nipple!
1315, For Once In My Life is a very good Stevie Wonder from 1968.  As was the theme for Motown albums from the era, it contains a couple of hit singles, covers of non-Motown songs and covers of Motown songs.  &quot;For Once In My Life&quot; shows off Mr. Wonder's beautiful voice.  &quot;Shoo-Be-Doo-Be-Doo-Da-Day&quot; is fiery number that has a southern soul style and &quot;You Met Your Match&quot; is in the same vein.  Some other good songs include &quot;I Don't Know Why&quot;, &quot;God Bless The Children&quot; &amp; &quot;Do I Love Her&quot;
1316, This is a wonderful app for helping you keep track of what you are eating.  I started using it to count calories and because I had to record my food intake everyday I became really conscious of what I was eating.  There are millions of entries in the database.  The database is updated by normal everyday folks that shop at Aldi's or Giant Eagle or even Marcs.  I have been surprised on all the foods that I have found in this app. If the item you are looking for is not there, then you can enter it using a computer and it will now be in the database available for everyone.  I hit my weight goal and I continue to use this app to look up foods and their calorie content.  It definitely helps me stay conscious of what I am eating.
1317, I am sad to say this product only does half of what I was told it would do. Unless mine is just messed up, it charges with a USB cable to your computer but does not sync. Also is also another minor problem...there are no 2 color LEDs to show charging or fully charged. The front LED is white and stays that way as long as it is plugged in no matter if the phone is in the cradle or out of the cradle, as well as if it is charging or fully charged. (I thought that this might be because I was charging using the USB cable so I tried the plug and still white). Overall it looks good but the 3 stars are because it doesn't sync which even on the BB site it says it will do.
1318, I bought these for my boyfriend for Christmas and he loves them!  Unfortunately, I also love to wear them.  Haha.  The waistband is awesome.  Really well-made.One recommendation, though.  This is the second pair of these pants that we've purchased.  He put the other pair through the dryer and they are not nearly as soft anymore.  We hung this pair to dry and washed them in cold; they're in great shape!  I'd recommend cold wash and hang dry.
1319, I bought this belt for my 2003 Chevy Tahoe with the 5.3L engine and 145A Alternator. Make sure you know which alternator you have BEFORE purchasing this belt. The 105A alternators use a slightly shorter belt. It fits perfectly, doesn't make any noise and works great! You will also need the smallerGoodyear 4040377 Gatorback Poly V-Beltfor the A/C system on these vehicles.My 145 Amp Alternator has a 145A stamped on the side, visible from the drivers side. You could also look for the old belt part number on the existing belt and order accordingly.
1320, This dvd was first released in 1985 titled &quot;Yesterday Once More.&quot;  I had always held hope that this video would make it to the dvd format. I own both vhs and laser disc versions of this release and I must say, dvd makes a world of difference. Dvd audio is getting more popular, A&amp;M is releasing a dvd audio of the Carpenters greatest hits titled &quot;Gold&quot; on October 22nd.  As with all dvd converted video and film, the sound is excellent, the picture crisp. Not one change has been made to this dvd, the video was perfect the first time around and is now preserved for all time.
1321, I play a lot of sudoku games some are better then this one but there are a lot more that are not as good. Don't care for the background &amp; they could spice it up more as far as looks. I feel that it would be easier if the numbers were on the top instead of the bottom but that's just where I prefer them. Wish that u could go right to the score webpage instead of just getting a brief flash of where to go. Also could make the &quot;Easy&quot; &quot;Hard&quot; etc buttons more spread out &amp; larger. Other then those little issues its a pretty good game.
1322, Shellac, fronted by famed producer Steve Albini (Nirvana - In Utero, Bush - Razorblade Suitcase, Chevelle - Point #1), are impossible to compare to any other act in modern music.  Their sound is completely unique, aided by guitars that Steve built himself, and the famous "room mic" technique that Steve has perfected to give drums a sound that makes drums on other records sound like sticks banging on plastic buckets.  This CD is a staple for those of you looking to get into underground music.  Just listen to the end of "In a Minute".  That is about the most difficult progression for a band to pull off seamlessly, which Shellac seems to do with ease.  That's only one of the many accolades for this album.  I could literally go on and on.  However, I'll just leave it at this: as far as indie music goes, this is as good as it gets.
1323, This is one of the best face wash ever!!! I had used many brands, many just leave your face with"too much"... slippery...or dry. My skin is combination, dry to normal, this is perfect for me. The smell is wonderful, nice. This product leaves my skin feeling soft and clean. Love it and highly recommend it. The seller is one of the fastest on delivery service, received my product in matter of 2 or 3 days, on standard shipping!!! Got an excellent product.
1324, Everyone is right, this is a great tub for your little one.  My baby is 5 months old and was outgrowing the infant bathtub that sat on the sink.  He fits great into the infant side and he had a blast the first time he was in the tub.  It was the first time he could splash around and the first time Dad heard him laugh!  So worth it.  He doesn't find it so amusing anymore but it's great for me because I can give him a bath alone now instead of having to have another person hold him up in the tub.  Yes, the drain is really slow so I do what someone else does and use a large plastic cup to scoop the water out so I can refill with clean water.  But, no big deal since we use the cup to rinse his hair anyway.
1325, These 3M flexible plastic spreaders are decently made and reasonable priced. The set included three different size spreaders, one each measuring 4", 5" and 6" wide. They worked fine for mixing, spreading and smoothing the 3M #262 and #272 Bondo Glass body fillers I used them with. The pinkish color of these spreaders is supposed to represent the color of regular #262 3M body filler when it is properly mixed with hardener, so you can use them as a visual reference if needed. The spreaders cleaned up easily with acetone and a rag after use. If the ends become worn or rough, I find you can easily trim and taper/sharpen them by running the edge over a sheet of sand paper on a flat surface, like your work bench. Overall, considering what I paid for this set of spreaders here on Amazon, I think they were a good value and would buy them again when needed.
1326, I have 3 copies of this on vinyl, so, obviously I dig this record! I am a classic rock, jazz, rap,..well, I love all genres. This particular Cd is great! The sound is awesome..like vinyl..surprisingly..I played it in my Bu-ray player, so..? The recording has been a favorite of mine for a long time, clearly. So, if you're a fan of Miss Ross, Motown, oe entertaining live recordings..buy this! One thing, though..ahh you knew it was comin'..or not..either way..I am looking to purchase other Motown/Diana Ross //other cool stuff that have been remastered to Vinyl Replica quality..the liner notes, etc. So, get on that! ;)
1327, Very useful to keep you aware of how many calories you are consuming and once you figure it out it is pretty easy to use. Problems-- a big one is that people put incorrect info in the database so some of the counts are way off. Especially on homemade foods. Adjusting portion sizes is not simple if you use less than a given size on an existing item. Getting out of an entry if you want to make a change or just check calories without adding a food is frustrating. Even getting to the screen where you close out your day can be a real challenge sometimes. And if you don't leave the program open- for example if you don't want others using the device to see your weight- you have to hear all the notes about how you are starving yourself... I think the program needs a help file with clear directions. If it has one I havent seen it. Overall- worth it. Though now that I got an iphone with Siri its easier to ask her to find calories counts for me.
1328, i have been using this for years and have purchased these for friends and family.  In the winter time, my motorcycle (CBR 600RR) used to die when I didn't disconnect it.  However, with the tender plugged in all winter, I never had trouble in Spring.  I no longer have my motorcycle, but now use this for my Troy Bilt Riding Mower (Super Bronco).  It works wonderfully and I keep it plugged in all winter, and when grass cutting season comes along, my mower starts right up.  You simply connect the clamps to the battery correctly and just "forget about it".  It's a smart charger, and won't over charge your battery.I highly recommend this if you own a Riding Mower or Motorcycle.  Batteries aren't cheap!
1329, This is one classic that breaks through all the genres, radio formats, music formats... I don't care if it's a scratchy old LP, an 8-track you found up in the attic, a brand new CD, or that second-generation cassette  you wore out on your last road trip. &quot;What's Going On&quot; is  essential listening in any shape or form, though I prefer the CD simply  because it won't wear out (but I'm trying). I feel sorry for anyone who  only knows the two or (if you're lucky) three hits that turn up on the  oldies stations too frequently. Some 15 years after I discovered  &quot;What's Going On&quot;, I'm still fascinated and moved by every note,  every beautiful lyric. &quot;And All He Asks of Us Is We Give Each Other  Love&quot;...words to live by.
1330, These wiper blades were easy to install and have performed great during the rainy season here in Southwest Florida. During the summer we get torrential downpours almost every afternoon so you want a wiper that works and these make a big difference. They perform great during a heavy rain. I ordered mine in December 2010 and I'm doing the review now because I wanted to see how long they last. Well it's been almost two years and I'm just now needing to replace them. Actually, I probably won't even replace them until the start of next rainy season (May 2013) but I figured that after two years it's time to do a review. These are fantastic blades, especially for $12.70.
1331, I've used the Voyager 855 for about 15 hours and I am pleased with the purchase. I use it with an Iphone 3G while working out. For me having the headphone cables out of the picture is worth the drop in music quality. I get some pauses in the music if I don't turn off the WiFi on the Iphone. I get the impression the phone gets too busy to keep the music playing. The noise cancellation is not very good on the out-bound portion of phone calls, but I don't use the phone that much while working out. (No one wants to hear that much heavy breathing.) For the price it is a great buy.
1332, The inconsistencies in this app's database has ruined it for me. When you search for a food item and you find 5 entries all with different calories and nutrition info it, it renders the app useless to me. Part of the convenience is supposed to be the ease of logging foods so this is a serious problem.Add the inability to customize charts in the app by date and I have to shop for something else. Dev does not respond when contacted about these issues.It's disappointing because I loved the web integration but if I was willing to work with inaccurate data and guessing games I wouldn't need this app in the first place.
1333, Its Fine but, The secondary little side flap that gives a place to store cash or cards is a Joke.I see little picture like windows?! Only a (1) Postage stamp could fit in them, and don't think about removing it once it is in.The Card slot is not going to really hold but one card and you will not want to keep it there once you see it there.And you almost have to RIP the flap open (Good snaps) But not the Magnet snap. I find myself always TRYINGto set it (the magnet snap), in it's little click/closed hole.Great Price though so I have it till I can find one like I used to have.
1334, I got the sweat shirt and I like my sweatshirts to be really large and roomy as I sometimes wear them over other shirts.  I ordered and extra large thinking these would run closer to men's sizes --but I wish I had ordered and extra extra large.  The sweatshirt fits and it is comfortable enough, but I was looking for a more roomy oversized fit and I didn't really get that by ordering the extra large.  So I believe the sizing is not what some might be expecting since it's a man in the picture wearing the sweatshirt.  But the sweatshirt is labeled unisex.  Just beware of the size you are ordering.
1335, I now have 3 pair of these in different colors. I normally wear a woman's size 7-8 and I order size Medium in these. I like how they fit me. Baggy and very comfortable. Love the length. I'm 5'6&#34; and they are quite long enough. These are very well made pants. I have had my first pair for a couple of years now and they show no signs of wear at all. And now that these are fulfilled by Amazon I can get them in 2 days. Old shipping method took forever. Might just have to get one more pair.....
1336, Plain and simple, it works really well. The water just beads off your windows at maybe 30 mph and sometimes you don't even have to use your windshield wipers (although it isn't meant to be a substitute, just a compliment). I completely agree that it increases your reaction time and it is easy to apply. A few minutes to apply this product to your windows can mean to difference between a safe drive home and a nightmare, knock on wood. Stay safe. Your safety is #1, the product is worth it.
1337, I ordered three pairs of these Izod Metrix chinos, and they fit beautifully.  The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is that one pair had some stitching and pressing that was off, but not really a fatal flaw.  The other two pairs were well finished, and all three fit the same (try that with other brands!).  Their big selling point is the "Metrix" idea which adjusts the fit to the waist/inseam configuration, and it certainly worked for me.  They wear well and look good.  The pocket material is in a blue striped material, which is odd, but no one can see it, so who cares?  And the good thing is that the pocket material is substantial (compared to other similarly priced pants).  Obviously I like them because I ordered three pairs, and I would order more if they came in other colors.
1338, By far the most vocally gifted (if, unfortunately, not most successful) member of New Edition, Johnny Gill, whose voice can either be buttery smooth or deep and growly, keeps his new jack swing to a minimum here and opts for more of a red-hot loverman persona, and it really gives him the best chance he's ever had to make the most of his voice. He really gets sensual here with the beautiful ballads "Maybe," "Take Me (I'm Yours)," and "4 U Alone," though every song is a high quality, well-written and produced piece of work.
1339, At first ,i was fooled by this record,comparing it with his masterworks of the seventies.By listening to it over and over, i went deeper to it,and i really enjoyed it.At that particular time of his career,STEVIE WONDER had nothing to proove;he had already won many GRAMMIES(all deserved),and was a confirmed superstar.This record has STEVIE going back to his roots without disminished what he had already accomplished.When an artist of this stature has made it to the top,it is never easy to continue in the ever changing world of popular music.STEVIE has done so by remaining himself and by creating songs which shows that he cares about this world.All the songs here demonstrates the different sides of the artist in a true display of his melodic gifts.
1340, I purchased this to use at work.  I work all day on a PC and like to listen to the music loaded on my BlackBerry.  The cord from my ears to my BlackBerry was always getting in my way.  I didn't want to be connected by wires to it (I have pulled it off the desk a few times) but I still wanted to be able to skip through my music.The Jabra BT 3030 was exactly what I needed.  I wear it around my neck and use retractable ear buds to limit the cord mess.  I love being able to pause, play, skip forward or back without having to touch my phone.  It even works great to attach my work badge too.The music sounds great.  And I have used it for phone calls too, with no complaints.I would recommend this to anyone looking for a great way to listen to their music without having to be attached to your music.
1341, Here is Stevie Wonder's initial project for the 1980's. This album was released in or around September 1980. According to Norm N. Nite's Rock On Almanac,MASTER BLASTER debuted on the radio that month. Wonder did not have hits at all earlier that year. I like I AIN'T GONNA STAND FOR IT which was later covered by Eric Clapton. I heard several songs on Music Choice's Classic R&B channel. One of them was ALL I DO. Anyway,it's a very good album. This is one of five albums that Wonder released in the 80's.
1342, CENTURION is not really a history lesson. It is however great entertainment. The photography  is breathtaking and on blu-ray one of the best in picture quality I have seen so far.The often mentioned "logical errors" I can live with. This is more of an action movie anyway and there's a lot of very bloody action in it, well deserving the R rating.Great and well-paced direction by Neil Marshall (Doomsday, The Descent) this is in my opinion his best work so far.All of the cast (mainly British actors since this is a British production) are excellent in their roles, Michael Fassbender as always, is outstanding, but the best performance is by Olga Kurylenko, who plays the mute pict scout Etain. Playing a character without dialogue can be very difficult, but she is totally believable every second she is on screen.The director thanks Walter Hill in the end credits, a nod to THE WARRIORS which has some similarities to the story.
1343, I've used this product for several years now, but it isn't working very well lately.  The main problem is that there's very few bubbles and I found I was having to use more and more product to get my dishes and pans clean.  The consistency appears to be the same, but it just doesn't clean.  In fact, this is my main complaint with most all of the Mrs. Meyers products I've used.  They smell nice but don't do much beyond that.  I feel like I'm using a product that was devised for a reniassance home - lots of perfume to cover the bad smells, but no cleaning power.  What a let down.Update: Thanks Christopher Davis for the confirmation that the formula was changed by the manufacturer.  It was pretty good prior to the change.  Not so much so now.  I still stand by my review!
1344, Some of the most intricate, gripping and cerebral American TV I have ever seen. I have always preferred English drama to some of the absolute drivel on American TV and all the reality nonsense, but here was a show that had the promise of excellence, only to find out after watching the first season that it has been cancelled!! I believe the TV execs were living on another continent when they decided to can this show and I personally believe it was a very sad day for discerning viewers. Oh well back to the BBC and English drama till another gem appears.
1345, It's just not worth the time and effort to use this app unless you are dedicated to your phone, ipad, or kindle. I'm not an avid hand held device holder (unless I'm reading) and refuse to own a cell phone, so maybe my lack of need for a cell phone gives me the mindset that this app is not good enough. What is not good for one person is great for another depending on the needs. As for the app itself, it is very interesting and has a lot of choices to aid you in the right direction. I would rate it higher if I had a use for it. Try the free version and if you like it then keep it :) Everyone has different opinions and this might be a great app for you!! Take care =)
1346, Here are eight videos from songs Stevie Ray Vaughan and his group did earlier in the 1980s. It's always a pleasure to hear SRV play his guitar so every song has something to offer. Most of them in this small collection are fast numbers and fun to hear. They are also short numbers so the whole video is only a little over a half-hour in length.In addition, some of the videos are very humorous, particularly the first couple. There are some scenes you laugh out loud. So....if you want 36 minutes of up-tempo rock-blues with some fun videos, this a great tape.I see now that this is available now on DVD with bonus songs.  Wow, I'll have to order it!  (Better late than never.)
1347, I've never counted calories before and still don't have to. This app does it all for you. I got it from a friends recommendation and in just 5 days I have lost 3 1/2 lbs with no work outs or sacrifices. It really makes you Realize how much you consume In your daily life and overall teaches you to make better eating choices. For example a serving of something maybe small in quantity and not as satisfying with a high calorie count vs something with a larger quantity in a serving which satisfys more due to more in the serving and the calories are equal to or less than your original choice overall its super easy to use and work. And is a new lifestyle one you get the hang of it.
1348, I started buying the new wipers that conform to the shape of your windshield a while back. I bought quite a few pairs and they aren't cheap. No matter which brand I bought, like Bosch etc, they wore out quick or didnt work on my expeditions windshield shape (they worked ok on our accord). These valeo 600 wipers are old school design but WAAAAY better quality and performance. They are silent, and eliminate ALL of the rain (I live in Seattle, this is important lol) and they are WAAAAY cheaper!I found out about these because consumer reports rated them the best wiper and I fully agree!

1350, Maybe it gets to the exciting part somewhere, but all I've seen so far is melodrama and weird situations - like when the girl who the main character picks up  meets two strangers that are man and wife doctors, she allows the wife to give her a physical exposing that she was sexually brutalized and on drugs!Yeah, sure! And then this dock blabs it all to her new boyfriend, then the main character after sleeping with her for several days, only after the doc's report, notices the welt scars on her back!  Umm, I don't think so.And all this while, the main character is bawling about his wife who passed away 6 months prior, and the only action we get from him is him repairing the propellers on the doctors' boat!I am glad amazon has a lenient return policy. Four days of on and off reading and still no action gets this thing returned!
1351, I carry many portable devices and sometimes I'm away from the office or home all day long. It's nice to have this charged and ready to go in case of emergencies. The charge capacity is great for it's size. It's perfect for my iPhone 5, 4G hot spot, and iPad. Probably not fully charging all three on one charge, but enough to last me the day. I don't use the laser pointer or the flashlight at all, though it's nice to know I have it in a pinch. I don't use it everyday. When I do need it, it's great.
1352, I love this app. It has a bar code scanner when you download to your smartphone. It scans it and automatically comes up with your nutrition information. Or you can just type in the name and do a search. You can also use the recipe builder. This was number one for me. I hated not knowing how to add my homemade foods to other diet trackers. With my fitnesspal (or my fitnesspal.com) you can put in your ingredients and amounts and the number of servings and it will tell you what your calories are and will add it to your meal tracker. It also has a very larger exercise tracker and you can do a quick add if you just want to add the number of calories. You can also add friends using the app. This is a great companion with the site. Could not recommend more.
1353, Let me say that I'm a Beatles' fan, owning all their offical released material and 2 bootlegs of Decca Sessions and Christmas Records.But this is simply impossible..."Hard Day's Night" was a fun and interesting peep into the Beatles's daily life, great script and acting."Help" was a mediocre adventure movie, still with a nice plot and reasonable script."Yellow Submarine" was just a cartoon."Let It Be" was one of the greatest recording session film ever made.And this must be the greatest boo-boo the Beatles' ever made. Can't comprehend until today, why...they even had the nerve to release it ?? There is no plot, script is horrible and boring, the cut into the magicians' place was simply meaningless...The only thing worth watching is the "I Am The Walrus" song clip...
1354, I bought this because of all the great reviews in magazines and on t.v., naming this as the best mascara on the market.  I have never been allergic to a cosmetic but this product burned my eyes every time I used it and accidentally got a little bit inside the lid.  The brush is small (some may like that, some may not) and it is not the slightest bit clumpy (excellent) but the reaction I had to it outweighed the positives and I returned it and got my money back.
1355, If you have a camper or RV why wait until you need one?  Seriously - driving under trees in campgrounds it's only a matter of time until you tear off the factory plumbing vent cap.  And you won't notice it at the campsite, you usually notice it later, when you're nowhere near a place to buy a replacement at any kind of reasonable price.  But one now - store it away - take it with you.  Then, look up, on your camper or RV's roof - what's that?  The vent cap is missing?  Now you've got one in your emergency repair kit.
1356, I SHOULD SAY DID IT AGAIN. WHY WOULD ANYONE CANCEL THIS FIVE STAR SHOW?  IT IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES. THE DRAMA IS REAL LIFE, THE MEDICAL TERMS ARE PERFECT FOR THAT ERA AND THE ACTING SURPERB. REALITY TV AT ITS BEST. I WOULD GIVE THIS 10 STARS PLUS. LIKE A REALLY GOOD BOOK, I DID NOT WANT THIS TO END. YOU FEEL A LOSS AFTER. IT POPS INTO MY HEAD EVERY DAY. THATS THE SIGN OF A GOOD DRAMA... TOTALLY WORTH WATCHING EVEN IF IT IS JUST THE TWO SEASONS......CAT
1357, I love this serum. It keeps your skin feeling soft and silky. I have been using this serum for several years and would hate to be without it. I prefer the fragrance free serum but have had no problems using the regular scented formula. A little goes a long way and I would say the bottle last close to a month using it once to twice a day. I have tried expensive formulas from the makeup counters of department stores and have never found a moisturizer that was better. It reminds me of a product that was out years ago named, Stop Signs, it was $80 a bottle back in the 1990s and this product is just as good at a lot better price. I plan to keep using this product and hope Olay keeps it on the market!
1358, I LOVE THIS APP !!! IT IS EASY FOR ME TO FINALLY KEEP TRACK OF MY EATING HABITS WITHOUT ALL THE WORK ...I. WOULD ALWAYS FORGET TO WRITE THINGS DOWN UNTIL NOW PLUS IT HELPS FIND ANYTHING. I NEED TO LOOK UP THE CALORIE COUNT ON...WITHOUT THIS APP I WOULD GIVE UP AGAIN BUT NOW I LOOK FORWARD TO KEEPING TRACK.THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR MAKING MY NEW LIFESTYLE EASIER. BUT IF YOU ARE GOING TO UPDATE ANYTHING PLEASE GIVE MORE SIZE CHOICES ONCE THE FOOD IS ENTERED...LIKE 1/4 CUP 1/2 CUP ETC WOULD BE NICE
1359, This was a great idea for a series, or a movie. I think people were turned off by the constant time sequencing in the first few episodes, I almost stopped watching because of it.But it turned out to be a surprisingly interesting story.I never thought that Sophia would turn out to be a manipulating homicidal maniac, but towards the end of the series it became clear that she never had any intention of living in peace with the human population. It seems she was just stalling while the plans to invade Earth were being worked out.I liked the suggestion that ancient drawings in Europe weredepictions of the Guardians that are here to protect us from the invaders.This could have been a great long running series if the writers had spent more time on it, and the producers were serious about making the story, not just trying something out.
1360, This app is really a browser that goes to the most popular websites like CNET and Wired completely separate from Silk.It has two modes for viewing the website in mobile or desktop view.You can add websites that they miss like io9 but I found some didn't load and I had to change the settings to open those sites in a standard web browser (Silk).With that setting, the Tech News app became nothing more than a glorified bookmark manager.The settlings affected all the news links. It was either all load on the local browser and forget io9 or load them on Silk.iO9 doesn't have much on it to have this difficulty and loading the app just to load Silk is very clumsy at best.
1361, My husband wanted to get this Tornado to instal on our new RV.  He took it out of the package and hooked it to the water hose to test it out before cutting a hole in our Black Water Tank and it gives off a powerful spray.  He went ahead and installed it and we used it on our 4th of July RVing trip, about a week after he installed it.  You could actually hear the Tornado working and blasting the tank clean.  We got clear water coming out of the Black water tank and knew it did it's job!  Also, it made dumping the Black Water tank a breeze.  We did not have to drag water hoses inside our RV to spray out the Black Water tank because this Little Wonder does that job for you!!!  Love it and would Highly Recommend it!  Happy RVing!!!
1362, I love the ease of the avent bottles for feeding, cleaning, transporting.....everything.  When I found out the bottle design changed, I didn't want to have to re-buy all new bottles ( because the nipple design changed to fit and perform with the new bottle too).  I went to several local stores that were already sold out so came here to stock up.  I bought all the sizes I will need in the future.  Also, these nipples fit in the avent trainer sippy cups.  This is great for my little one since he didn't understand how to use the spout on the one that came with the cup.
1363, First of all, I'm a huge Police fan...That said, this DVD is a good glimpse into the concert atmosphere circa 80's! I love seeing the fans and their clothing and hair styles of that era. Understanding this, the sound recording and video quality is also vintage 1980's! Although the DVD features 5.1 audio in both Dolby and DTS, the sound is a bit dull and unsharp? There's no projection...like the Cream Albert Hall DVD. Andy Sumner's guitar should sound crisp and sharp, but it doesn't. I have a good Sub. but I don't get a great bass projection. I'm sure this is the best they could do with the technology of the time. Live concert miking has improved a lot since then. The visuals are great, and you can get a real sense of what it was like at the concert. I just wish the sound was better!
1364, I cannot praise this series enough. This is a great example of tight and taunt script writing and acting. A man on the brink and flirting with self-destruction is brilliantly portrayed by Idris Elba and his supporting cast. If you want gripping engrossing and fast paced TV drama .. this one is absolutely for you. I have watched all available seasons (on this and other sites) at least twice, (this one thrice) and enjoy it as much each time I watch. Idris Elba is an acting talent, or rather a force, that can rarely be equaled.
1365, Rick James is tha man!!  Street Songs was his strongest lp, allowing Superfreak to reach the top 20 in the billboard as well as #4 on the R&B; charts.  "TEMPTATIONS SING!"  Hammer really ruined it 9 years latter and Rick should have continued to get money from him.  Give It To Me Baby (#1 R&B;) and Ghetto Life are dancable tracks far from the disco scene, but my favorite from here is definitely Below The Funk (Pass The J) - Reppin' his hometown in this 2 and a half minute funky lp track. Fire & Desire with Teena Marie was what sparked Fire & definitley Desire for the whole album.  Too bad this was never a single, but it is probaly the most famous lp track by the ol' boy Rick James!Just git this cd!!!  "It's a Celebration!!!"
1366, Only time will tell how long they last. But I've had shirts from expensive mail order houses that wore through the elbow in less than a year, and from cheap no-names that lasted ten years. These look nice both with jeans and with a sport jacket.* * *Follow-up less than two months later: After only a few wearings and washings, two of these have started to come apart at the seams. This shirt is way too light and flimsy. I would not buy these again. Dropped my rating from four stars to two. Hopefully my two remaining shirts will last longer.I will stick to the Hanes, which seem to be better quality.
1367, Great in the sense of being very good, that is, but it also has a wide variety of items.  Sad (Penny Candy, Guess who I saw Today), funny (no synonym starting with s), satirical (Boston Beguine), sensuous (Eartha Kitt at the start of her career, with the memorable "Monotonous").  Foot-tapping melodies like "Lizzie Borden".  Enjoyable singing and dancing.  All set within a minor but very funny skit.  I repeat, great variety.
1368, This sudoku game is perfect for my kindle fire. It might have been the first app I bought (well, I didn't buy it. Because it was free). This is so good, however, I would have paid for it! I'm such a sudoku fanatic - every time I saw another puzzle book I bought it!! But now with my kindle fire it's so easy to play - no clutter or mess, and of course the kindle travels better. I just got my kindle fire in December, yesterday downloaded and installed the update, which makes it even easier to play - and if you're racing the clock - you can now play faster with update....I highly recommend this app!!!!
1369, What a rip-off app! I just paid out for more coins and didn't even receive my chips!! Somebody better give me some chips or give me back my coins from Amazon! I thought this was a good application but not no more. This app does not deserve a rating at all but I have been playing it til now. Boy you know how to rip off people! Here is your 1 star rating it doesn't even deserve that rating as far as I am concerned. You better quit cheating people on this app!!!
1370, I have been using Olay Regenerist daily serum for 2 years now and I am very impressed.  For an inexpensive product it worked much better then expensive ones.  It goes on velvety smooth and in the morning when I wake up my face glows with a nice radiance.  It brightened under my eyes and made my face shine.  I tried other products to see if they would measure up to Regenerist but none did, they weren't even close.  I would recommend this product to anyone wanting a smooth youthful glow.
1371, After our twins got too big for baths in the sink but still too small to just sit in a tub, we were at a loss.  All of tubs we saw were meant for one kid and we were hoping to be able to give them baths at the same time.  I finally saw the EuroBath and decided to try it out.  It worked fantastically!  One baby had to recline while the other partially sat up, but we could finally give them baths at the same time.  We've been using it for several months now with no problems whatsoever.  Our kids love it and so do we!
1372, I like Tweetcaster.  I have two other twitter clients on my Kindle, but this is the one I use the best, it is better than both Twitter's interface and the Janetter app.  What makes t better specifically is that it gives suggestion for the people you're @-replying or it helps complete your hashtags.I can't give it five stars because there are times where there is just a huge section of my stream that doesn't get loaded, and if I'm trying to read all the way down, the three hour missing chunk is a distraction. That chunk is the reason I have even tried other apps.All that said, as far as I know Tweet Deck isn't available easily on the Fire.  If it was, I would use the heck out of that.
1373, Overall, this book is a fairly interesting look at what it might be like if humans colonized Mars, complete with political squabbles and human failings. The best aspect of Robinson's book is the incredible amount of realism he has introduced.  It is as if he was actually part of the expedition working as the historian and personal chronicler.  Some of the seemingly real events he describes include the multi-year sandstorms, technology use to increase atmospheric temperature and bio-domes. On the downside, the pacing is a bit slow at points and the descriptions of some of the land forms and climate gets tiresome for someone who does not get extremely excited by such details.
1374, As another reviewer mentioned, this is not a miracle worker - but it sure makes a difference between using it and not using it.I'm early 60's and have been using it about 6 years.  No, it doesn't make me look 45.  But it is wonderful at clarifying my skin and smoothing the texture of my face.  Not greasy or oily, and if you want more hydration, simply layer a moisturizer for that purpose over it.  I use it every day and love its light, velvety finish.  Plus, it beats the heck out of department store brand prices for products very similar in quality.
1375, I got this because my wife saw my other charger but didn't want a bulk one so i ordered the IMP52D and she loved it!great to carry on purse or in a pocket. It ususally charges 2 times my Blackberry torch and it also charges my playbook(only once) and the same amount of charges for the iphone.Also like the fact that has Flash Light and Laser beam, good for those who have dogs or cats lol.For Blackberry users like me you might consider buy a retractable usb cable because the Cable that comes with it won't charge Blackberry Torch neither the Playbook, so that was only the issue i had, but apparently this was made for iphone, so iphone and android users, you guys won't have the same issues i had.Another thing that i want to point out,the unit doesn't come with the power adapter. so use the one that comes with your phone.
1376, For me, Without Remorse is Clancy's breakthrough. He takes his characters emotionally to the next level. Predictably the action and wartime policy intrigue feature prominently, as John Kelly (aka Clark) is dispatched to Vietnam to free a POW. But the other half of the novel is about his vendetta against a crime syndicate in Baltimore. What did they do to face the wrath of this one-man wrecking crew? They killed a girl who nurtured him in a time of need. Kelly's revenge is brutal amd just. There's an interrogation scene halfway through the book involving a decompression chamber that pushes the emotional boundaries of the novel and moved me to tears. The ending chase sequence explains how Kelly reemerges as Clark later in the Ryanverse timeline.
1377, No, this album isn't as great as Innervisions or Talking Book, but yes, it's still a classic. With one song that I can do without (&quot;Do Like You&quot;), this album shows that Stevie still had some tricks up his sleeve. &quot;I Ain't Gonna Stand For It&quot; is just plain catchy while &quot;Lately&quot; (later covered by Jodeci) brilliantly narrates a lover leaving her man for another. Of course I can't forget about the MLK, Jr. tribute &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; and the reggae-influenced &quot;Master Blaster (Jammin')&quot;, two hits that helped sell this album. This is the last of the great Stevie albums and Hotter Than July is definitely hot. -EJR
1378, It's a fine film. It has a good actress which i like. But it misses so much action. it is rather boring then fascinating. It has a good graphics in some parts of the movie, while in others you easily can see, aliens don't seem very real. It's not a bad movie, it just misses a few things. I don't find it to be a waste of time. So try it before you say it is bad. Some people might find it good, while others say it is boring. Definitely, give it a try before saying a word or two.
1379, I bought this when my son was too big for the sink at about 5 months. We used this for 6 months. I would hang it from the shower curtain rod with a plastic ziptie threaded through hole in the tub and then one of these "S" shaped rubberized hooks from the Container Store. After my son started walking and climbing, he just used it for leverage to climb out. I though that I would get more use out of this, but at 11 months it became unsafe since he was trying to climb out of the tub (not the tub's fault). So the eurobath was replaced with a rubber rub liner with suction cups and now he walks around the real tub.
1380, Good value for the money.  Of course durability is the best test, but I'll update that in a year.Great fit for me (XL).  Length is good and fits well through the shoulders.  Washed up very nicely on the 'out of the bag' initial wash.  Based on a bad experience with similar sweatshirts in the past, I used the lowest dryer setting to eliminate the possibility of shrinkage.  With imported clothing, it's really hard to know what is set and what is not.Definitely recommend this sweatshirt to anyone looking for low price and decent quality.
1381, In Square Circle is another classic Stevie Wonder album.  The album features his usual themes; ballads, upbeat r&amp;b and songs with a social bent.  The socially conscious songs are all strong including &quot;Land Of La-La&quot;, &quot;Spiritual Walkers&quot; and &quot;It's Wrong (Apartheid)&quot;.  &quot;Part Time Lover&quot; is a shimmering workout number that is as good as anything he's ever done.  The song became his ninth and final number one song (although he would hit number one in 1986 as part of Dionne Warwick's &quot;That's What Friends Are For&quot; song).  &quot;Go Home&quot; is an underrated gem with it's driving keyboards and funky beat.  &quot;Overjoyed&quot; is a lush beautiful ballad that just soars to the heavens.  In Square Circle hit number four on the charts but it marked the end of a 14 year run of chart dominance for Mr. Wonder. To date, he has not reached the top ten on either the singles or albums chart since this album.
1382, I haven't had the need to install this yet but plan to this summer. I always use ACDelco parts when working on my GMC because I know I can't go wrong with genuine GM parts! I will update this review once I install it. Thanks Amazon for having ACDelco in stock when I need parts for my truck.EDIT: Installed this along with theACDelco 15-20676 Idler Pulleyfor my 2000 GMC Sierra 4x4. TIP: If working on a similar truck, make sure you remove the top half of the radiator shroud to make it easy to get to everyting. Install is pretty straight forward.
1383, It seems to me that Maybelline is synonomus with mascara.  You would think, then, that given their years in the industry that they would have mascara down pat!Not so, as evidenced by this product.  It is not a good product because it does not do what it is suppose to do which is to make the lashes look longer, thicker, etc.There's a company in Australia that makes the best that I have found.  Then there's Lancome which is always good.Both of them are much more expensive:  4 times more so.I would think Maybelline would improve their product and if it's mmore expensive to do so, then do so and charge perhaps 10 bucks for a product that will end up doing what its suppose to.Their liquid eyeliner surprisingly does well in competing with Lancome....why not their mascara?
1384, I love MyFitnessPal.  Even though I'm not trying to lose a lot of weight quickly, it really does make you accountable for what you are actually eating.  I like that it isn't only about calories, but carbs, fats, etc.  I really like all the info in it's database and also exercise figured into the whole plan.  I'm not hungry, have been enjoying treats as well and have lost 3 pounds in two weeks.  I'm really mostly interested in just being healthy.
1385, I don't know if I could pick one album to be the clear best, but &quot;What's Going On&quot; is definitely a strong contender. Everything about this album is spectacular. The lyrics are always inspiring and beautiful, and the vocals are wonderful throughout the entire album. Also, the production is incredible, with dense layers of instruments, vocals, and percussion making for a symphonic blend that's so deep you hear new things every time you listen.With all parts of the album combining into a wonderful whole, it's no surprise the album is so addictive. It can be listened to daily, over and over again, and never once wears out its welcome. &quot;What's Going On&quot; is a masterpiece that anybody who likes music should have to own. Brilliant.
1386, Yay! I finally have a bluetooth headset that people can actually hear me.  I have tried 8 others from cheap to expensive with very marginal success.  They all connect just fine but the sound quality on the other end has never been very good.  This was really a problem with my Treo 650 and a little less with my iPhone 3GS.  The H680 has a tremendous range (I've used it more than 60 feet away from my iPhone) and good volume (I've never turned it up all the way yet) and good microphone.  Like another reviewer, I love the slide switch to turn it on.  That way I can have it in my pocket without it accidentally being switched on or off.  Also, it's so light that I've forgotten I had it on.  That lightness can feel like looseness but it actually is very secure.  I highly recommend this product-- especially at the $22 it's showing on Amazon now.
1387, This stuff is impossible to find at local auto parts stores. Both walmart and auto parts stores carry a different brand, which leaves the red coating and is in a much smaller bottle. However, i've come to realize over the years that Permatex products are good-to-go, top-notch products. From brake cleaner to this stuff, you can't go wrong with Permatex. This product goes on purple, and one can immediately tell the difference in material quality over the other brands. Does a phenominal job at preventing corrossion on battery terminals. Good stuff.
1388, Stevie Wonder's dazzling versatility comes to the fore in this 1980 album. "Hotter Than July" runs the gamut from soulful reggae ("Master Blaster") to social criticism ("Cash In Your Face") and country funk ("I Ain't Gonna Stand for It"). The Martin Luther King tribute of "Happy Birthday" makes for a celebratory finish. Surprisingly underrated, "Hotter Than July" deserves a place alongside "Innervisions" (1973) and "Songs in the Key of Life" (1976).
1389, desert essence makes so many great tea tree products. i love the pure oil. i use it for my face, as a feminine hygiene product, and as a blemish spot treatment. i NEED this product always it is a crucial cosmetic for me. it is best diluted with water because it is a very strong oil. i find it lasts a long time. just put a cotton ball on top, a quick turn upside down and run a little water on the ball. i'm sure there is an easier way but it works for me. (and honestly i like the burn so i dont always dilute it.) i really bought it at first because it was recommended as an acne treatment, and it was the perfect treatment for acne but there are so many other uses.
1390, There are so many great, lengthy reviews about this phone already, I'll keep this one short and simple.It's a great phone.  And if you have an 8125 or 8525, then it's time to upgrade.If you're still carying a PDA and a cell phone, then this is the phone for you.  All in one, with GPS, a decent music player, a good camera, and a great operating system (WM6).A quick tip: don't bother with the $10/mo TomTom service.  Download the free Microsoft Live Search or Google Maps applications which both work perfectly with this device's built-in GPS.
1391, Great acting by actors who seem to relish the limelight.  The intensity of this actor makes me think of a lightning bolt looking for a place to strike.  He's pretty to look at in a dark sexy way, but I really like to see an ensemble cast with multiple plot lines developing each character; I think I get more cluck for my buck.  I get the impression that larger than life character wouldn't permit that somehow; he upstages everybody else to death.  Subsequent episodes might tone him down a bit, but I doubt it.
1392, This was a fabulous show if not for THREE points:1. David Gilmour wasn't there2. They just &quot;had&quot; to put Sinead onstage, staring at her feet the whole time. I fail to see whats so great about her.3. Roger Waters made a mistake in choosing Van Morrison to sing &quot;Comfortably Numb.&quot;  Van is a classic singer, no doubt, but he just doesn't have the right type of voice to sing &quot;Comfortably Numb.&quot;  If David Gilmour couldn't have been there to sing it, they should have used someone with a soft, mellow voice that could have sung the song the way it was MEANT to be sung.  By the way, is there anyone out there that can tell me who the two main guitarists were?  One guy was kinda skinny and had black shoulder length hair and played most of the guitar parts. The other guitarist played a Les Paul, mostly.  Thanks.  JonM11100@aol.com
1393, I ordered two shirts. Both arrived over packaged and took two days for overnight shipping.After reading some reviews, I expected something like a Tshirt with a mock turtleneck. The shirt is thicker than a Tshirt. I find it similar to a very thin sweat shirt without that fuzzy stuff on the inside. I am pleased with the quality.I should have listened to other reviewers when they discussed size issues. I ordered a medium and this thing is huge. I washed it in hot water, dried twice with superhot air and it is still way too big. After washing and drying, I held the shirt next to one of my medium Hanes' longsleeve pullovers. The shoulder points of the turtleneck were approx 21.5 inches compared to the Hanes at 18 inches. I did not measure before washing.Three stars were deducted for the Shrek sizing.
1394, These are  nice wipers. The design makes them less susceptible to icing/snow than the older style blades but they do not clear the windshield any better. I have had them for about 6 months and they are skipping and leaving dry spots just like those blades with "pressure points" so the claim that "even pressure technology" doesn't seem to be any kind of great improvement. They will probably do better if you clean them and reset the way they lay on the windshield every so often. They are always bent in the same direction after use and I guess they get a memory/set to them.
1395, This set is incredible. I would like to focus on disc 4, the &quot;Rare and Unreleased&quot; disc. It features some of the coolest unreleased Jackson material like the driving funk of the 1972 &quot;Love Scenes&quot;,  the incredible 1972 &quot;Can't Get Ready For Losing You&quot;, never heard  Corporation classics like &quot;Coming Home&quot; and finally a listenable  Jermaine song &quot;I Need You&quot;. There is however a mistake on disc 4.  Number 9 on the cd is not the song it says, it is actually &quot;Ooh I'd  Love To Be With You&quot; from their 1973 SKYWRITER album, but it's still a  worthwhile collection
1396, The beautiful singing voice of Karen can enjoy itself to the all-songs last, also mixing a precious picture. It is covered by the hit song from the beginning to the last, probably song selection is also substantial, and it could be said also as a best album. Although there are [ an image ] oldness and indistinctness for a while, considering an age, since camera work is very good, it is beautiful.Various scenes, such as a figure in Karen which sings "Please Mr.Postman" happily in Disneyland, and the stage in "There's A Kind Of Hush", are also seen.The figure sung so that Richard may have the outstanding talent and it may look at Karen with love is wonderful. Just by there being older brother Richard with the outstanding talent, I hope that Karen could also be lively and was able to be sung.I recommend to the direction referred to as liking to regard as their songs and the image like a material especially.
1397, This replaces my previous one of these that just failed after 8 years of good service keeping my summer only vehicles' batteries charged over winter storage. You will likely need to get one or more accessories such as the 12 volt extension cords so you can reach all your vehicles, cigarette lighter plug-in instead of standard battery clips that come with the unit, etc. Highly recommended. Also have the two bank unit that was causing am radio interference on the house circuit, returned it under warranty and they repaired it on a timely basis. I am able to get very long battery life using Battery Tender products.
1398, This is a very good novel, in the same league as "Queen of Angels" of Greg Bear. I think that this one is one of the best hard SF novels of the first half of the 90`s. Certainly is much better than "Moving Mars" by Greg Bear (December 15, 1994). I say this even though I really like "Moving Mars".The pace of the novel is very good, the characters are well drawn, the level of research is astounding. YOu can actually follow the action on a Mars map (and will need to in order to understand most of the novel). In that aspect it feels like reading Tolkiens "Lord of the Rings", you have to had a good knowledge of the land because it gets to be another character in the story. Look for a good map of mars on the internet, there are plenty of good ones from NASA
1399, I think the marine battery to use as a backup for something and I need to keep it fully charged all the time I selected this item to do that for me. It does an excellent job. There is not a whole lot to say about it you just connected to the battery and plug it in and it works. There are no settings buttons or other things to worry about there are just two LEDs that let you know if it is charging or if it is fully charged. I am very happy with my purchase and I would recommend this item to anybody who wants a good quality battery charger.
1400, This book contains a Monty Python and the Holy Grail reference on page 325 of the hardcover. That's about all you need to know about the "quality" of this entry into the series.If you want just a bit more, know that an entire plotline contained in the book (4 chapters or so) could have been excised and reinserted at the end in a couple of paragraphs.Marginally better than AFFC, but only because there's no Samwell Tarly. As hard as the characters try to get stuff accomplished, nothing really happens.
1401, The three star rating is only for Baryshnikov. There is no choreographer in the world that could make Baryshnikov look bad.That said, I didn't like this version of Carmen. Carmen?  What's with the chairs?  Petit makes Barysnikov's part look more like Escamillo's than Don Jose's.And I did not like Zizi Jeanmaire at all.  For one thing she looks older than "Don Jose" and overly eager, rather than disdainfully seductive. But I don't think that's the main problem. I just hate the choreography.If it wasn't for the pleasure that I get from looking at Baryshnikove dance (or just stand there and give you the entire story with the look on his face and his body language) I would have rated this dvd one star, maybe two if I was feeling generous.
1402, I don't know why the website will not let me have it at one star!  I DO NOT mean 5 stars!I bought the Diaper Dekor first based off these reviews online, and I hated it!!  I does not work at all. Then I got the diaper Gene and it's better but still I think it sucks. Not only do you have to buy the special liners (annoying and expensive) it's confusing to operate.  I finally just used a small trash can in my laundry room and empied it out every few days.  At least it didn't annoy me!!! :)  I am looking into the Diaper Champ now as it uses any regular trash bag.
1403, This product is not lined. It's made of a thicker material then what I've come to expect from most unlined bra's, but it's not the same. If you want a lined bra then don't get this one. Also I&#34;m a 34E. I read that the band runs large so to order a band smaller and cup larger. I figured that if the band runs large then I'd just go down a cup size and keep it a 34. Well I'm not very full and the top of the bra was super wrinkly. I tried on a few t-shirts and you could see the wrinkles (and my nipples) through the t-shirt.
1404, These seem to be well made and of good quality.  Hopefully they will hold up.  If they do, then they will be worth the rather steep price, I guess.  Based on the other reviews here, I bought the XXL (13-14) size for my size 11 feet and they fit fine, a little extra room in the toes which is fine, snug everywhere else.  As mentioned elsewhere, they are ugly, but they feel good and are very comfortable.  Like moccasins.  They can breathe which was very important to me.  They are warm, too.  Soft and quiet on a hard floor.So far, very happy with them.
1405, I know I should only do one star or five star reviews because those are the one that get read, but this book is really right between. So much so that I don't even know if I will read the next in the series or not. Science of Mars ecology and stuff like space elevator is interesting and pretty solid, which science on stuff like immortality treatments is just plain silly and puts everything else in doubt. Economics and psychology are really, really stupid. Characters are pretty dull individually but as a group, keep you reading. No real protagonists here.
1406, I don't yet have a SACD player, but I've been buying hybrids since I can enjoy the remastered CD layers now, and be building a SACD collection for that day in the future.  With few exceptions, hybrid CD layers are superior to the regular issues, although I've been burned a couple of times when it was obvious that they simply put the old CD version on it instead of using DSD and down-converting to 16 bit PCM.Interestingly, this CD layer is not much of an improvement over the 2002 remaster except that things hold up much better when the mix gets crowded and many instruments kick in and get loud. At this point, the 2002 remaster gets thin while the MFSL version hangs in there. This alone might be enough reason for an audiophile to pick this up.
1407, Back in the eighties the critics loved them, fellow musicians raved about them, they were called the Rush of thrash and they blew away bands like Slayer and Metallica. It never helped them achieve the following they deserved. If they do have any form of a cult following it would be based around Tommy T Baron's sensational guitar work which by the way reaches it's apex on this album. It's progressive it's technical but it's catchy it has songs that generally clock in around 4 minutes. Coroner is exemplified by the song D.O.A absolutely stunning stuff. Music lovers know a metal band has never been as underated as Coroner.
1408, This is a fantasy book for teens.  Yep!  There really are evil monsters that follow the biddings of satanic witches.  Our trucker hero, Josh, is caught up in a small, isolated Virginia town's nightmare when he accidentally runs over a newborn in a stroller.When he refuses to recant his story that an evil woman pushed the stroller purposefully into the truck's path, the bad guys have got to silence him.This was written in an average writing style with silly, unbelievable characters.  Gray, I'm sure, will have lots of followers--those who like books about witches, dragons, zombies, and anything else teenager-ish.  Please don't waste your time with this!
1409, I have very sensitive skin and have used Babor products for a number of years.  They have made my skin better at 63 then when I was 43 or even 33. While those products are expensive and long lasting, they give awesome results. After reading recent reviews,  I decided to try this one as I am on a strict budget for a few months.  I would consider this average.  It absorbs very quickly and does make my skin look good.  I have no breakouts after using it for about a week.  The one thing I am not too keen on is that it contains silicone and I try to stay away from it.  Other than that I would recommend it for the results you may get.  It is definitely worth a try.
1410, Luther rates with other top TV serialized dramas -- it's not just another cop show.  The characters are well-written:  complex and fallible, very fallible.  There are definitely bad guys (usually a new serial killer each episode), but the good guys have plenty of flaws too.  And the actors are up to the writing.  Idris Elba (Luther) and the rest of the cast deliver great performances.  Definitely worth watching.  The only downside:  only six episodes in Season 1.  Worth it nonetheless.
1411, This diaper caddy is a wonderful addition to our baby room which has very little counter space to put stuff. It fits our munchkin diaper warmer but just barely and holds about 20 diapers in the storage below. When you do pull diapers out sometimes 2 or more come out. The side holders aren't locked in so if you try to pick up the entire diaper caddy just by holding the side pocket it will fall.If you're looking for more reviews of baby registry essentials, read the baby registry guide from AllMomsArePerfect.com. Good luck!
1412, The enigmatic Mr. Clark was always my favorite character of the Ryan canon, and this book takes him back to his beginnings, in the 1960s. Really Clancy's only "historical" novel, this thriller is probably his most emotional, with a story that pulls you into a vengeful thrill ride.It's been a common ploy in thriller fiction, the highly trained soldier going after the criminals who murdered his girlfriend, but no one does it in such a visceral manner as Clancy in Without Remorse. I've read the book probably five times since it came out, and it never gets old. Highly recommended.
1413, I wasn't sure at first. It seemed a bit slow and contrived. However as it developed it becomes an entrancing puzzle with interesting characters. If there were additional season(s) I would have paid to see them if they weren't available with Prime.It has almost become the case with this show & others that the producers, if they are thinking of canceling, should first try making the content available via Amazon to see if there is an audience for the show that simply hasn't seen episode 1 due to channel clutter.
1414, We got this gate because we recently got 2 puppies, and have gated off all areas of our house so that they don't run all around the house causing havoc. However regular gates are such a pain, having to step over them, is a hassle. Especially while trying to carry a new baby. So this is great. Only complaints: I wish the opening was larger, it isn't huge- but to be fair, the description does give dimensions. The only other thing that is taking a while to get used to, is there is a bar at the bottom of the gate- even in the opening, so you still have to watch your step, but it is less of a hassle than having to take down gates or step over them. overall, I would recommend.
1415, I found the development of this series to be ponderous in the beginning; the saving grace is Helen Mirren who is unable to comfortably smoke a cigarette. This and the slow development of the plot make for a less than delightful series. I don't know if I will go on to watch the second episode. I probably will and I do want the series to elevate itself in my mind. This is a contemporary series, which I don't usually watch but I think I am willing to give it a second chance.
1416, I used the free version, and liked it so much that I moved to the Pro version. Very easy to visualize, add people, and post tweets. I really like the Black background, white fonts. The font size can be increased which is awesome for me. Lot of customizations. No complaints and after using bunch of twitter clients, I settled on this app. Never crashed on me. If anybody likes screenshots, leave me a comment. I will upload within a day.I have used on 4", 5.5", 7", 9.7" android versions and had no issues whatsoever!
1417, Given Diana's limited vocal capacity and her counterpart artistry in the show business, i do believe she released probably the best album of the '90's when it comes to her career.She chose carefully amongst producers and came up with a solid product thanks to the work of Narada Michael Walden and Jon John.Not leaving Nick Martinelli out of the whole project.The first single off the album, TAKE ME HIGHER, sees ms Ross in top form, then she slides thru magnificent ballads (I THOUGHT WE WERE STILL IN LOVE and I NEVER LOVED A MAN), gets into some R'n'B (SWING and KEEP IT RIGHT THERE - thanks, Babyface), shows some chart action with GONE and tops it all with a great disco cover of I WILL SURVIVE: very good tracks, real nice album.
1418, I think the Wix filter is as good as the OEM replacement filter for half the price.  I have had no problems with this type of filter although I do think the Wix motorcycle version could be a little more competitive for the price.  I have done a lot of research on filters and think that the Wix and Purolator filters are very good for the price in comparison to OEM.  I would need to buy a case of the Honda filters to get the same price break.  There are filter comparisons on the North Texas Prelude Owners Group . org website that has filters cut apart to show you their contents and construction.
1419, Although the premise of this movie was somewhat intriguing, the characters, editing, pacing, and acting were not.  I've heard of slow, but THIS was slower than a 3-legged turtle.  It seems that aliens have landed and occupied earth six years ago, there is now an "infected" zone where you cannot leave, and a wall has been constructed in keep people in/out.  Yeah, I get the symbolism there, but this movie becomes an exercise in a very lame excuse to tell a love story.  I didn't care for either character, the monsters look like floating octopi, and I never felt the characters were in peril of anything--except their own insipidness (if that's even a word).  So go ahead and watch...BORE yourself to death...
1420, The movie "Freakonomics" is based on the best-selling book of the same name.  Several documentaries, each with different directors, show how economics can work in daily life.  Cheating on pupil tests, the drop in crime rates in the USA, incentives in potty training, pupil achievement, and other interesting nuances that economists deal with are featured.  A lot of economics is predicting behavior of people, and that can be dicey.  Overall it provides a light and interesting way of looking at the dark science. The movie has good ideas and the scripts move well to keep you interested.
1421, I was always a fan of the DuckTales series as a child, but even then found this movie to be dissapointing.  It's a cute movie, and has great characters to work with, but it lacks the charm and fast pace of the show.  Kids may become restless watching it (I know I always did) as it tends to drag its feet a bit.  Most of the jokes of the Geenie are stale and fall flat.The familiarity of the classic characters does make it a good comfort movie.  I don't care for the central villain, Merlock, who never comes across as particularly menacing, but his sidekick Dijon is a nice addition and provides some comic relief while fitting in with the true DuckTales style.This movie is worth viewing once or twice, but you might opt to rent it rather than purchase it, as it's not something that will hold your interest if you watch it often.
1422, I got the medium size and they fit my shoes perfectly. I wear size 9.5 medium width. They have a nice smell to them and really fill out the shoes. I use them on Allen Edmonds and A. Testoni's and they fit good on both of them. If you want to spend the extra money, the allen edmonds shoe trees feel sturdier and seem to be of better craftsmanship. Another thing with these is that one of them seems to be cut incorrectly, it just looks odd compared to the other half. But all in all, there should be no reason to pick the allen edmonds over these, they do the job, and do it right. Unless you're a picky perfectionist, you will see no faults with the quality of this shoe tree.
1423, 2 days after I installed these, I noticed the drivers side wiper looked loose/crooked. I went to inspect it and the little plastic piece that locks onto the wiper had cracked. I figured I just had a dud, so I returned it to amazon and they sent me a new one right away.This time the blade lasted about a month and then the same exact thing happened. The same plastic piece cracked. Maybe it can't handle the cold weather or something. It is very thin, cheap plastic.I usually buy Bosch brand wipers, but Amazon had these on sale for 2 for $20, so I gave them a try. I'll be sticking with Bosch for now on.
1424, This book (book 4 in the series) was slower than the other three, but still excellently written.  Many of the main characters spend the majority of the book moping (Dany & Jon Snow), or drifting fairly aimlessly (Tyrion & Mormont).  Stannis and his "queens men" finally leave the wall, but barely.  They encounter no Lannisters to advance that plot.I'm still re-reading it (read it as it came out, then reread the other 3, and then it again), and enjoying it, but I wish it had progressed the story a lot farther.
1425, A lot of fun to watch  One of those concerts that you enjoy enormously watching on a nice system but likely wouldnt enjoy as much if you were there since you wouldnt be able to see what was going on as much.Personally, I dont think Lauper and Sinead were good choices for the two masterpieces that they were given the blessed opportunity to sing but that is nitpicking.  Roger sings the majority of the important parts and he does so very well.Roger Waters' other concert video, In The Flesh, is better overall but then again, In The Flesh is the greatest concert DVD of all time so it wouldnt be fair to compare them.
1426, Let me just say that I am so glad I found this CD! I am a late thrities individual who remembers every one of these hits, some of them performed with the Jackson Five.  For those of you who don't know the rest of them; Wer'e almost there, Just a Little Bit of You, Cinderella Stay Awhile, and a few others were from a album called FOREVER MICHAEL, which I bought when I was 8 years old (and still have, scratches and all, I wore that sucker  out!)  I had wanted the powers that be to put all of those songs on CD and they have minus 1 or 2 cuts (Where is the song DAPPER DAN?)This brings back great memories, songs that were cute, simple this was Michael they way most of us remember him.  If you have an ear for nostalgia, when songs were simple get this CD!
1427, INNERVISIONS is Stevie Wonder squarely in the middle of his early-'70s peak. Continuing his ongoing proof that popular music can have a social conscience, INNERVISIONS features some of Wonder's finest pop singles while dealing rigorously with spiritual and sociological issues. &quot;Living For The City&quot;is a detailed ghetto anthem along the lines of his friend Marvin Gaye's &quot;Inner City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holler),&quot; while the wildly funky &quot;Higher Ground&quot; looks to reincarnation and salvation. Both cracked the Top 10 in 1973.The celestial thread continues through &quot;Jesus Children Of America,&quot; which brings together Christianity and transcendental meditation, and &quot;Visions,&quot; a delicate plea for peace and brotherhood that sounds like an homage to John Lennon's &quot;Imagine&quot; (released two years earlier). Successful in pretty much every way--it earned Wonder his first of two straight album-of-the-year Grammys--about the only question left by INNERVISIONS was, how to top it?
1428, Teena, has done some outstanding work in her lifetime, no one can deny that...and I've gone out of my way to collect it all again on CD.  But when I tell you, this little gem is the cream of her crop, I kid you not!  The songs, You make love like springtime, Irons in the Fire, Young Love and Tune in Tomorrow, plus the springtime reprise (well as you can see practically the whole darn set) will move anyone with a heart, spirit and musical soul!  This is a rare gem of talent exposed and on display.
1429, Slint was recommended to me by Amazon because of my love for early 90's, late 80's indie rock bands like Dinosaur JR and the Pixies. My first reference I had to think of was Tortoise. That wasn't weird because when I did some more research I found that one of the members of Slint later joined/formed Tortoise.They only recorded two full length albums of which this is the last one. It has just 7 songs but they last at least 7 minutes.What makes this album good? Tempo changes, volume changes, key changes. Musically it is very interesting to listen to, though it might take a few turns in the CD player.I won't listen to it that often because it is difficult but it still sounds very good for an album that is more than a decade old now.
1430, Living in a ski resort town, we have snow and ice for 5 months of the year.  After two very serious falls this winter even when wearing my chunky soled winter boots I decided it was time to invest in some Yaktrax.  They go on fairly easy, and come off even more easily (but you will get hands dirty with whatever ice and dirt is on the bottom of your shoes).  I wear a size 9 and the small fit my shoes perfectly.  I also bought a medium for boyfriend (and also works on my bigger size 10 boots), but we have yet to try that set.  They did a great job for walking down our hilly street in slushy, icy snow.  This coming week we have another ice storm on the way, so will probably get a chance to test them on solid black ice surfaces that run from our frost door to our parking spot spaces down a steep hill.  Will update once they get the true test.
1431, This is a great mobile charger for cell phones and portable devices like the first and second generation iPads.  Note that the output is 1A, so it isn't powerful enough to charge larger devices, like the third generation iPad or the Kindle Fire that require 2.1A for charging.This mobile charger is small and compact and will provide multiple charges for your USB device.  Also note that this charger has one USB port, where some chargers have two.If compact size is important to you and you have a smaller device that only requires a 1A charge, this is a very practical mobile charger for you.
1432, this is a great dvd.sure there are alot of crowd shots,there are some amusing effects put on in the editing stage,and i have watched this numerous times and i do not recall any shots of sting flexing his muscles or running his fingers through his hair.what is on this dvd is hands down one of the greatest frickin'bands ever to grace the planet.if you have any interest in the police at all this is a must have.the audio is fantastic,the images are crisp and clean,and sting, andy, and stewart play just a fantastic show.i never had the good fortune of seeing the police in their prime,so if you didn't either it would serve you well to buy this post haste.if you want the audio of this show buy the police live double disc.disc 2 is this show in its entirety.also be aware police fans on sept.12 stewart copelands "police home movie" titled everyone stares will be released.enjoy.
1433, This book is one of the best from TC!  I'm glad my kindle purchase was for a re-read however.  There are many typos in the kindle version (e.g. a 1 rather than a I).  Some/most of these are just annoying, but some make the text unreadable/incomprehensible.  I don't know what the process is for converting a book to kindle format, but if I had to guess based on the types of typos that I'm seeing in there I'd guess it's some for of OCR (which is fine, but they really need to do a better job at proof-reading the digitally converted text).  I've noticed these types of errors in some other kindle books, but this one seems to be much worse than any of the others I've seen in the past (there seems to be an error every few pages).
1434, I agree wtih a lot of the other posters saying that this was a very good show that AMC canceled after only the 1 season. But to be perfectly honest, as good as this show is, with what some of the highest rated shows are and what shows are always in the top 10-20 or come out as the highest rated shows, does it really surprise most that an intelligent show like this got canceled? I mean when shows like Survivor, Amazing Race, The Bachlor & Bachlorette are among some of the top rated shows...is there really any mystery left as to why this show got canceled? I mean people have to pay attention while watching this show and use their brain...so in other words...this show was unfortunately was a goner and would not appeal to the masses. Shame it really is an excellent show!
1435, As of August 2013, Nizoral is once again available through mainstream outlets. The main ingredient, ketoconazole, has been shown to block DHT and, hence, reduce male pattern hair loss.  I wrote to the company to get their opinion and they generically refuse to comment saying the product is not FDA approved for hair loss.If you have access to a journal database via a medical library, you can locate many research studies demonstrating the DHT blocking capabilities of ketoconazole.  This effect is very different from suggestions that other dandruff shampoos reduce hair loss by removing dead skin cells or improving blood flow to the scalp.
1436, I bought this set base on a lot of reviews saying it charge their Ipods. What I didn't realized is what kind of ipod they have, they might have a 3G nano as we know won't work with 4G nano. I tried the car charger, it works but can not play and charge at the same time. For the house charger it doesn't. I look at the label and it say compatible with ipod 3G. However the product description says compatible with 3G, 4G nano, etc. I bought this to enable me to charge without having my computer running. The car charger is important if you are in your car for a long period of time charging without playing. Not worth returning, the postage cost more than the items.
1437, Make legs look fabulous almost too perfect but love it. Nice and strong material and wont run easy. I ordered a Small and fits good but for anyone over 115 pounds may be too small. These cover everything but still look real and can wear with skirts but beware it does get a lot of people staring at your legs. I can see why cheer leaders and dancers wear these as they perfect the leg and give support. I'm fair and the light toast works well only because I use Lorac Tantalizer on arms, chest and neck otherwise would be darker than my fair skin but will be perfect for summer. I will order more in other colors. If you are looking for something more sheer go with Oroblu Repos 70 which I also have and love but more like a strong pantyhose.
1438, Over the years I have bought many different brand of tennis shoes.  These Easy Spirit are the most comfortable I have ever worn, so that is all I purchase now.  They conform to the foot, they are comfortable, the leather on top is soft, and they wear well.  I put them in the washer and then set on top to dry and they turn out great every time.  The only time I have to re-order is when the heal wears to one side only because of the way I walk.  I have since bought an insert for inside the shoe to tilt my one foot so the shoe does not wear like that any longer.  I LOVE THEM.  I have also bought black to wear through the winter with slacks.
1439, You just can't be a Marvin Gaye fan and not own this one!  This brother was soooo before his time.Nobody has a voice like his. (....though Sam Cooke does come to mind, actually.  Not that they sound alike so much, but there is a PURE MUSICAL QUALITY to their voices that few others had then or have now.)This project is the bomb!  Though written several years ago, the message in the musicis still very relevant today!  And Marvin delivers like no one else can!FABULOUS
1440, It's just not possible that anyone has ever been more authentically cool than Thelonious Monk;he just had an unbeatable combination of the coolest name-and the composing skills,playing ability and "street cred" as one of bebop'sfounders to back it up. And, it's unlikely that there is a better documentary-on anybody-regardless of anyone's interest in jazz.While,Monk isn't shown playing his classic 'Straight,No Chaser',with his distinctive style,he is shown playing 'Round Midnight' while  smoking a cigarette-which could get him shot today;the documentary was made in 1989 based largely on footage done in 1968.Monk died in 1982,married,but living in the home of Baroness Nica De Koenigswarter(Rothschild);she appears in this documentary and is definately a character who deserves a movie of her own.In any case,Monk is shown playing 'Pannonica' which he wrote for her.
1441, I gave it 2 stars because I liked the concept -- alien life purposely brought back to Earth, accidentally let loose -- so I decided to give it a go.  So not worth it. Nothing happens.  Nothing.  It is boring.  No, let me correct that.  It is BOOOOOORING!!!!  Way too many areas of the plot left unexplored; way too much meaningless conversation that does nothing to advance the plot; way too little character development; way too many unanswered questions; and the &#34;plot twist&#34; at the end was incomplete.
1442, The site is easy to work and this provides me the opportunity to allow me to keep a track on my calorie intake. It has helped making dieting easy and helps to teaches people how to eat healthy and provides a visual so that it is easy to see what one has eaten. To me it helps make dieting easier and lets one to communicate with others who are your fitness pals, which leds support and encouragement. i would recommend the app to anyone wishing to eat healthy or for someone trying to take a few pounds off.
1443, This is my first time giving Foyle's War 4 instead of 5 stars.  It isn't that the stories aren't great, but that following his resignation, there seems to be an emptiness as to Sam and as to Milner.  By 4 stars, I'm not even saying that the episodes are merely &#34;good&#34;.  They are better than that; just not eye watering for me as were the other 5 seasons.  I was late to discover this series and I took in the first 5 seasons in weeks instead of months or years.  I may merely be showing anxiety at nearing the end of the line.  With season 7, I'll just have to pace myself better.  I hope this helps.
1444, Ok so once again I download a game thinking this time I will master it and improve my skills, because I am good at math.....NOPE.Once again the hopes and dreams of Bonnie come crashing down but that is all good because they do allow for the &#34;dummy mode&#34; of Bonnie to play easy and feel somewhat ok about herself as I struggle through my puzzle.  I literally watch my kid play on hard mode and finish them in puzzle books in 15 minutes....I just don't see it.  She looks at me with pity....tells me &#34;it's ok mom, we all can't be good at everything.&#34;  She borrowed that line from me......  onward and upward - the game is great - me not so muchGreat job Icenta Inc.
1445, If you didn't own this album when it came out in '81, you had to be living under a rock. Undeniably funky, agressive, and smooth grooves. Rick James at his height here, but if you followed him beforehand, you appreciated his music before he &quot;Blew up&quot; with &quot;Street Songs&quot;. Motown has been stingy in re-releaing his late 70's and early 80's work. The only one that is out is &quot;Come get it&quot; which is good but, &quot;Bustin' Out&quot;, &quot;Fire it up&quot;, &quot;Garden of Love&quot;, and &quot;Throwin' down&quot; were masterpieces in their own right as well. Come on Motown....quit sittin' on these albums like you have done this concert on Disc #2 for 20 years.
1446, I ordered these in my waist size, in Russet Brown, to make up part of my steampunk outfit, but then actually tried to cancel the order because I worried they would not fit (being men's pants and I'm a woman).  I was worried they would not fit over my hips properly.  Well, no worries, they fit fine (although the zipper is cheap and took a few tries to get zipped).  They also look awesome for the outfit.  They looked a sort of caramel color online but in person they're a sort of greeny-browny color.  Nicely slouchy and Sky-Captain!  Ah yes, they are very long, but since I will be tucking them into boots I don't care.
1447, I own the 12000mAH IMP120D model which I was impressed with and led me to purchase the iTorch IMP52D. The IMP52D is much lighter and smaller which is great for extra portability. It is smaller than my current phone (The Samsung Galaxy Nexus) and complements it nicely  The LED light makes the unit double as a flash light and the laser pointer is a nice touch.Since I am a power user with my phone, the battery drains quick and its nice to have the IMP52D around to give it an extra charge. I can now get more than a full days use out of my phone without worry. The IMP52D also does a great job of holding its charge so it is very reliable. I would recommend this battery back for anyone that needs daily extra power for your phone, tablet, or other USB devices.
1448, We are so glad that we bought this gate. We use it in the entrance to our son's room. It keeps him in and our 3 dogs out. Completly hands free is such a plus!!!!!! Simple to use!!! Fits very snug...it isn't going anywhere. The vertical only slats are great because our son tries to climb this gate and I truely believe that if we had bought a traditional gate with vertical and horizontal slats that he would be able to climb it!!! I recommended this to all our friends already!!!
1449, I had high expectation for this headphone since I owned one Etymotic before and liked it. Once I got it, I put it on my phone and the plug didn't work properly. The headphone kept disconnecting and reconnecting back with phone while I was walking my dog. First, I thought it might be my phone since it is about two years old. So I put it on my boyfriend's phone (Galaxy SIII) and magic happened... The headpone doesn't fit in completely and I had to push it to get connected. So disappointed and returning it, waiting for UPS pick-up.
1450, I love not dealing with panty hose or garters.  Over the last ten years I have had increasing numbness in my fingers due to MS which makes getting dressed a real chore.  I wear pants most of the time but needed to put on a dress for a recent wedding that I attended.  Panty hose are very difficult for me to deal with but the thigh highs did the trick.  I was very worried that they would fall down on my 110 lb body but the A/B sizing worked well for me and restroom breaks were a breeze.
1451, Sounds as fresh today as it did when the original was released back in 1995. Having  their version of Night and Day included in the What Women Want movie was a good move, and should have helped them reach a wider audience. As a body of work, this must be amongst the best ever to come out of Motown, by any of their artists, and that should speak volumes. The arrangements and singing on these timeless standards will make your musical moments special, whatever your setting happens to be, cruising, chilling at home, getting your teeth pulled, (LOL)whatever. Don't be fooled as you look at the songs on offer because even if you've heard some of them, you haven't heard them like this.
1452, I chose this rating because this program is so simple to use.  and it helps me figure out what to have for a supper meal, if i can snack or not, and to be accountable for how much water i drink during the day and to reach the goals i want for exercise.  This is the simplest program, finding any food i've needed and it syncs between my computer and my phone, so there is no reason for not knowing what to order out or having to be in front of a computer to use it.  LOVE it!!
1453, Tried on my boots as soon as I got em and although they were a tiny bit tight at first, I'm now wishing I'd gotten a half size smaller.  I have a wide foot, but these break in easy. And fit my wide foot even though they're a B width!  They just seem a hair too long.  Love the stitching on the upper half.  Like how they feel..I'm hoping they have enough arch support for when I wear them all day.  All in all a quality boot!
1454, A former Pentagon strategic weapons planner, a brilliant nuclear physicist, a social worker from Penn Valley, a poet, and a nut, combine to blackmail the US government. So far so good. Demanding uni-lateral dis-armament, our anti-heroes claim to have a nuclear bomb aboard the tugboat Liberty May... .."..and if our demands are not met, by 4:30 tomorrow afternoon...this bomb will detonate...and we will all know ...fear..".  Powerhouse cast and bristling dialogue.  This realistic fake newscast can be seen as a tense drama, dark comedy, satire, and/or propaganda. (Pokes fun at the FBI too!) A must see!
1455, Okay, I have been biting my nails since I was a little kid. Nothing my parents told me stuck and I just kept going until I got into this interesting habit of improving my looks. So, I'm going for my nails now.I have been using this since February and it's doing great. Granted eating finger foods is a little difficult but if you really want long nails then you get past the bitter taste and just eat the food and learn ways to avoid the nails, like a fork! That's what it's for! I have figured that its better to eat fries with a fork any way. No salt left on your fingers.In short, this stuff is amazing. now i just need a strengthener because my nails are a bit weak and have broken once already. Mavala makes a great shiny coat over nail polish too so it looks nice!
1456, It's hard to imagine a more fitting tribute to the late, great Monk, an innovative stylist who penned "Round Midnight" and exerted a tremendous influence on Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, John Coltrane, and others. That's largely due to the copious rare footage of Monk, whose bizarre antics we witness on the road and in recording studios. His mumbling musings and anxious tics leave the impression of a mentally unstable man, and it is likely that his tempestuous nature was due to manic depression. But mostly, we hear and see this master keyboardist at work, most notably in a famous 1968 concert filmed by Christian Blackwood. Produced by Clint Eastwood, "Straight, No Chaser" is a respectful genuflection to an unusually gifted musician.
1457, How can you not like a book with a line such as :"Oh no, not in their wildest nightmares have they ever met anyone like me.The name they had given him in Vietnam boiled up from the past.Snake.  "corny, jingoistic, call it whatever elitist dribble you want, i think this book rocks!! Apart from this, the research he puts into the book should also be commended.I only hope, if at all they choose to make a movie out of this, they stay true to the concept of the book. As mechanical engineer, i appreciate Mr. Clancy's work even more because of his minute precision level attention to detail. John Clark's workshop,Hemingway meets John Rambo ...Great fun read, gets a bit gory in the beginning, then snake takes over!! :) Enjoy it.
1458, MyFitnessPal, when synced with a FitBit tracker, is a powerful tool to help you solve the age-old balance of Calories In - Calories Out.  In real time, when synced with a step-tracker like FitBit, I know EXACTLY how many calories I've consumed, how many I've burned, and how many I have left.Better than ever before, I know my intake by carbs, fat, and protein, as well as sodium.  The food data base is fantastic so far, even showing our locally-produced dairy items.The bar code scan function works great too.This is not the first Tracker app I've used, but with the ability to sync with FitBit, it is the BEST!
1459, I was hooked after the first two or three shows. I watched this until seasons end, and waited anxiously to begin season two. What I found was the same story lines over and over. The same disappointments over and over, with the exact same characters.I was also tired of seeing the Christian characters played as WAYYYYY over the top, and the Pagan as wise, calm and all knowing. It got old fast! I watched a little of season three, finding the exact same story line AGAIN! UGH I just couldn't watch anymore.
1460, I started a new skin regimen recently, retinol cream, AHA 8% cream and this Olay Regenerist Daily Serum, and I'm amazed that I can see a difference already, in a week. My skin is smoother and healthier looking and even a little tighter, altho there is not yet a huge difference in that department. Still, I recommend this as part of your skin care regimen because it seems to give the others a boost. I useOlay Complete All Day UV Moisturizer, SPF 15, Sensitive Skin, 6 Ounce (Pack of 2)every day, as well.
1461, John Cleese does a great job portraying the owner of this struggling inn. He is hen-pecked, frustrated, and has a short fuse. His domineering an dismissive wife orders him about, and pours sarcastic criticism when he fails to do as she bids. He hires the wrong workers, whether staff or contractors, and the results are hilarious. His waiter, Manuel, plays the part of a Spanish man struggling to learn English while attempting to serve his master well. The misunderstandings due to the language barrier abound, producing many hilarious moments. If want some good laughs, check this series of shows out!
1462, Like most FREE aps, either commercial ads interrupt play or just plain money. I was enjoying the game, and continued to play it until a pop-up came up indicating to buy more games to play this app. I thought it was FREE! Obviously I was mistaken, and uninstalled it both from my cell phone (smart phone or android or whatever you all want to call it) AND my FIRE Kindle. I cannot play a free game and then a pop up comes on and will not allow you to play again until a large amount of money is paid. I understand that we cannot play on LOVE!!! but for us that cannot afford to pay for simple games, then it should NOT be advertised as FREE. It is a paying/subscriber app and should reflect that rather than being a giant surprise.
1463, With the release of "What's Going On" in 1971, Marvin Gaye ignited the social consciousness movement in music. With a senseless war in Vietnam, and racism still prominent in America. Pollution of our water and the air we breath. And Black unemployment levels continuously rising, Marvin hit a spot that had been sorely lacking in music, with the exception of maybe Curtis Mayfield. And like Mayfield's "People Get Ready" he did it with a spiritual solution: "God Is Love", "Wholy Holy".It was America's time to stop and finally ask the question, "what is going on?" And now with another war raging in the Middle East, the question is still relevant today. Marvin's spiritual answers remain the only hope for this world in the 21st century. A thought provoking recording, smoothly edited with an operatic flow of listening, resulting in Marvin Gaye's masterpiece and most redeeming effort.
1464, I bought four products from this line--the Regenerating Lotion with UV, Daily Regenerating Serum, Night Recovery Moisturizing, and the Eye Serum. After two weeks of use, I'm pretty pleased. I'm skeptical by nature, and I wonder if anyone notices the change produced by skin products like these other than the user. But, I think this stuff does make the skin around my eyes look smoother and lighter, and it certainly moisturizes without being greasy. I have pretty sensitive skin, and I haven't had any redness or irritation, and certainly no pimples. I also don't notice any scent. I find eye creams especially irritating (Clinique was AWFUL for me!) but the eye serum is very soothing. I'm pleased with the results and certainly the price!
1465, I owned one of these 5 years ago and it worked reasonably well, so got another one this time around (previous one was given to my SIL).  I don't know what they've changed, but this one is bad enough I'm going to break down and order something else.  We've had trouble finding an outlet we can use that doesn't have other major interference (like if the alarm clock or toaster is on the same circuit).  Plus, for some reason we're picking up another kid and their family that is no where around us (no babies within 2 houses in any direction).  I can't imagine what they've heard us say based on what we've heard!  Going to replace it with the V-tech which is less than twice as much...wish I'd put the money into that to begin with.
1466, This is the best baby bath tub out there.  It is large, taking up a good amount of space, but when hung on the wall (there is a hole in the top rim of the tub for this very use) it's simple to take down and set up and then give baby a bath.  We've used it in two of the homes we've lived in, and it's worked great in both.  I used it on the kitchen counter in our small condo (as we didn't have much space anywhere else) and then I used it on the large bathroom counter in our townhouse.I tried that sponge shape for our first son in the regular bathtub and that really hurt my back (and he didn't like lying down in the water).  This keeps baby's head elevated even when he can't support it; but baby can sit up on his own later in the other end...  Win win!
1467, This is one of the most potent tea tree oil's I've ever used. I use this tea tree oil to kill acne, I take a cotton swab, dip it into the bottle and apply it directly to acne and the acne will disappear within 2-3 days. I also put this tea tree oil in a homemade mouthwash that I make, I mix 1 cap full in a 32oz bottle of water and salt, it winds up being a lot more potent than commercial grade mouthwashes. This tea tree oil is extremely potent, most folks may need to dilute it before applying it to their skin so be careful before applying.PROS:- Very high quality, strongCONS:- None that I can think of.Country of Origin: Australia
1468, Like his idols Marvin Gaye and Teddy Pendergrass, Johnny Gill proved equally adept at handling hard-hitting uptempo dance/club tracks and romantic slow-tempo ballads. The Hip-Hop flavored "Rub You The Right Way" was the big hit but the poignant ballads "Giving My All To You", "Lady Dujour", "Just Another Lonely Night" and the Quiet Storm classic "My My My" are this CD's real gems. Johnny Gill was simply one of THE best male R&B vocalists of the 1990s--as well as one (thankfully) NOT afraid to showcase his Gospel and classic R&B roots.
1469, I had great hopes, but was very disappointed with this book. None of the main are likable. Most behave like idiots that would never be chosen to lead an expedition to Mars. Further, the story is, sort of, told in the perspective of the character. But as the story moved through time, all of a sudden you are getting one character's story line to the exclusion of the others. Not attempt is made to integrate the whole story resulting in a very disjointed and impossibly convoluted book. Then there is a half baked attempt to turn this into a political theory discussion, with an incredibly violent revolution about 60% through the book that, effectively destroys everything that had been built in the first part of the book. WTF? The our surviving lead characters become a wandering lost tribe. It just makes no sense.To the author's credit, his description of the Martian landscapes are wonderful. But I can't recommend this book.
1470, Excellent books inspire readers to write excellent reviews.  Red Mars however is so tedious that even writing a review about what is wrong with it feels a lot worse than Monday shaving.Where to start?From the huge portion of the book, around 10 to 15% of it, which reads like a tractor operation manual?From the obnoxious and unpleasant characters, with nothing to like about almost all of them?From the magic elixir of youth discovered conveniently by a handful of Martian scientists?From the overall feeling, that colonizing Mars is something like a weekend trip to the beach?I could go on for ages, but it is pointless and I already feel the chore of writing this review heavy on me. If this is the best way Mars is colonized in literature, I would be glad never to leave the Earth - Luna system and read again and again the Heinleinian colonization with the Moon Is a Harsh Mistress.Still 2 stars for a two-page debate about the preservation of Mars, where the writer rises to a level well above his potential.
1471, If you like anything with action & suspense around the life of a spy, you will enjoy Covert Affairs.  I do like the show.... and all the characters, however, after watching episode after episode of &#34;Alias&#34; for free as an Amazon Prime Member....  I have to say...  It is hard not to compare the two and if I had to choose one..... I would choose &#34;Alias&#34;.  Since I've already watched all of those episodes, I will still be looking forward to watching Annie in Covert Affairs!!
1472, Mars might as well be Long Island, NY or any other Earth area where environmentalists are battling developers. The terraforming movement in &quot;Red Mars&quot; comes into conflict with those who want to leave Mars as &quot;red&quot; as we found it, moving the plot along nicely in this book and its sequels. But what really drives this book are strong characterizations...men and women who have believable motivations and interactions (loves, enemies, and sometimes combinations of the two).Although the series peters out a bit by the third book, it is an extremely worthwhile read and should satisfy fans who like hard science as well as those seeking character-driven plots. &quot;Red Mars&quot; is one of the modern classics that deserves to be read and reread!
1473, If you've enjoyed the first four books you'll likely enjoy this one. I agree with some folks that there seemed to be a lot of stuff simply not happening. I really didn't like the way things ended up with Jon. I think it took far too long to develop Dany. And I'm still scratching my head wondering what the hell purpose does Stannis serve? Seriously, either have him do something or don't waste so many chapters on him.It's not all bad though and the book is entertaining. It's not unusual for the books in the middle of a series to become a little stale as the author tries to tie everything together and setup the ending. All the same I'm looking forward to the next book.
1474, This is my favorite Tom Clancy gook to date. The book goes back in time to tell John Clark's fascinating history as a former Navy SEAL. The book takes you on two stories simultaneously; one being a secret mission in Vietnam to rescue American POWs, and the other, Clark's personal vendetta against a criminal drug ring. In the end, the stories cross paths. My only criticism, is that Clark's character is a little too superhuman, and a little more struggle on his part to accomplish his missions may be a little more engaging, that said, I was hooked enough to continue through this long book rather quickly.
1475, I enjoyed the first season until the last episode.  What is it with following the 'GOD' signal through the Universe?  I thought this series was about seeing the 'GODS' as false and that the ancients were the ones really go all this 'GOD' work.  I can see why this series was canceled.  Maybe sense they set the stage for this to be revisited in 2014.  I can see where they talk able the each part of the journey being needed before the next step is taken.  This is a very Buddhist approach to a journey.  I hope the movie where they re-visit this in 2014 improves the story line.
1476, There's a lot here to savor and enjoy. I liked seeing things pick up from AFFC, for example. The Cersei scenes remain my favorite part of this and AFFC, so sweet is the comeuppance. And I found myself remembering that Martin is a fine prose stylist, whose descriptions resonate and whose dialogue snaps.But we are in the doldrums, plotwise, as the various threads become too long to spin together. Tyrion seems to go everywhere and arrive nowhere. Daenerys's thread ends just as she finally does what we've been waiting for her to do for five books. Bran's story remains infinitely less interesting than Martin seems to think. And Jon Snow's thread is massively frustrating.But the biggest problem is the feeling that We Aren't Getting Anywhere. Hopefully Winds of Winter (publication date: August of 20??) will get this thing moving again.
1477, I don't have much to say, beyond what's already been said.I would like to point out that the notification noises(played through the headphones) are LOUD!  It hurts my ears every time I turn it on and off.  Maybe, after a few months of everyday use, my hearing will degrade to the point that it doesn't hurt anymore. I certainly hope not.  The only solution I've been able to find so far is to hold them away from my ears when turning them on and off.  Very annoying.
1478, I bought this for a dance number because my leotard kept creeping up and exposing my rear and on one occasion exposed my "kitty."  So I bought this as a last effort to keep my pretty costume.  It worked amazing.  Everything stayed in place.Tips.1.Use it about an inch under the area you wish to keep covered.  For me this meant gluing the leotard to my butt cheek to keep it in place.2.make sure the garment is where it is supposed to be an not taut.  ie. don't try to stretch the fabric and hope this will hold it because it won't hold that well.
1479, This is a great app but I lose quite often and run out of money fast.  I wish there was a faster and easy way to get free money.  If I run out of money I would have to wait 4 hours to get another 100 free coins and that 100 coin would last 10 minutes at best for me before I run out again.  To make the game more fun they need to incorporate a social component to the game with some type of achievements you can accomplish rather than simply level up.
1480, OK, guys have nipples too.  The front part (everything past the leather) is a very stiff weave - I had to move them well away from my nipples to avoid having them cut in (hard).  That said, they are also very durable, the clasps are functional and hold well.  The elastic is on the back straps below the leather only, and seems to work well.  I bet these would hold up a reasonably apportioned tool belt as well as they do my carpenter jeans with square, leatherman, large tape and razor knife in them.Added plus:  Suspenders with no belt = much more comfort for those of us with no hindquarters to support the weight in our pants without cinching up our belts like a python killing it's prey!If plumbers wore these they wouldn't need longer shirts!
1481, I wish that I had a Cozip case when I first got my iPhone. It probably would have spared my iPhone from a few inadvertent dings to its corners. The Cozip fits very nicely and adds very little weight or bulk. My iPhone with Cozip still fits nicely into my Incase horizontal holster.The polycarbonate Cozip may not be as tacky as a silicone case but it still feels secure in my hand. All other cases that I've owned in the past for various phones and smartphones have been made of silicone. Unfortunately silicone cases easily attract dust.I'm extremely happy with my Cozip case and highly recommend it for a little extra protection for an iPhone.
1482, Move over, King, Koontz and Saul!  Finally a female horror writer who's got what it takes!  As an avid horror reader, I picked up "Furnace" and, although I was far from being bored with the plot,  thought I had the story all figured out about halfway through the book.  WRONG!  This one will keep you guessing until the very last page. You'll  be amazed at all the unexpected twists and turns. What a fabulous read!  Muriel Grays is an asset to horror literature! Highly recommended to all  horror fans. If you haven't read her first novel "The Trickster", please do so as  well...you won't be disappointed.
1483, I've always considered buying this brand because I've seen it advertised in several magazines as a &#34;best beauty pick&#34; so I thought it must be good.  I really don't find it that great of a mascara.  I think it's more of the wand than the mascara itself.  It's a very thin brush and you have to coat your lashes like 20 times to get decent coverage.  I also prefer curved mascara wands because I think they make application easier than straight ones do.  This mascara has a straight wand.  I'd rate this product as average.
1484, I eat pretty simple lifestyle...I'm vegan...and this program has trained me to see my calories. I barely use it now. Only time I do is when I need to find a new food item being incorporated into my usual meals and how much I can eat of it and to calculate my calories burned by my varied workouts. Counting calories are very important! Whether on the cookie diet or vegan; you will gain weight if you don't watch your calories! This is a very simple and great tool for weight loss.
1485, I just needed something to remind me of my upcoming bills. I spent a lot of time setting up my bills and I liked the interface. However, there is no way to get rid of reminders for paid bills, because the only way they can be dismissed is by selecting to pay them through the apps bill pay system. The bill pay aspect costs money. I have a free bill pay service through my bank. Although it would be convenient to pay right from this app, I do not want to have to pay for the privilege. So I uninstalled it.
1486, I have never before counted calories so easily.  So many foods are in this product's list.  Further, it allows the users to create their own foods, select foods that are frequently used, and gives you a list of the foods you have previously entered for each meal.The product lets users see weekly reports, averages, and tracks your progress.  While I realize every person's body responds differently, the product projects the amount of weight loss that can be expected, given the meals that are recorded.I like this product, and am grateful that it had the recommendation from a nutritionist.
1487, Seriously? For an author who (I thought) usurps Tolkien, this is a really poor work. Lots of moving pieces around and not much action. The thing that really attracted me about Martin's first books was the sense of danger, the overwhelming fear, the classic "people are too stupid/blind to know when things are about to implode," etc. This book was just tiring. Do I recommend you read it? Yes - it's too important and good (still) a series to disregard but wow, this is really making us work. The last one or two better rock or it's going to be an incredible disappointment. Little hint, George - needs to be a little more bloodshed, a little more violence, a little more revenge, a little more tension (I can't believe I'm saying this to Tolkien, er, Martin).
1488, Eurythmics are one of the best and most enduring alternative bands of the last 20 years.  This DVD collection showcases the unique and distinctive style of this talented duo, whose music encompassed a broad range of styles and whose eclectic and cutting-edge videos remain an influence even to this day.  From their provocative early videos such as "Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)" and "Who's That Girl?" to such monster hits as "Here Comes the Rain Again," "Would I Lie To You?" and "Missionary Man," this compilation includes all of the videos Dave Stewart and Annie Lennox produced in the 1980s.  Eurythmics are rock video visionaries - uncompromising and not afraid to disturb, provoke or amuse.  If you are a fan of independent cinema and film in general, take a look at these clips and you'll see why this band is considered one of the greatest purveyors of the music video medium.  Check out [...] for more information about the duo's groundbreaking clips.
1489, Stevie Wonder has got to be the best entertainer of the century! I love this album. Actually, I love anything the man makes. But, I am not being biased here. This album is really a masterpiece. My favorites are Visions, Living For The City, Golden Lady and Don't You Worry 'Bout A Thing. This album is considered to be his best by many Stevie Wonder fans. Personally, I think that his best album was Songs In The Key Of Life. However, this album features the same brillance of that on SITKOL.
1490, its great in that it remembers what you search for, keeps track of past workouts, and the likes, but wont give credit for calories burned during weight training. at all. there isnt even a spot to enter the calories burned if you knew how many. but what about those of us who dont have all this info burned into our brains? I am over on calories several days straight because it doesnt want to give credit for my weight training. how is this going to help me lose weight?
1491, I've gone through several backup battery solutions over the past few years and all suffer from either a lack of power or were ridiculously large.  The iTorch has in the short time I've owned it proven it's worth.  I've recharged my Nexus 4 from 14% remaining to full and then topped off my Nexus 7 from 36% with no issues, then had a friend ask if she could borrow it, allowing her to get a good extra bit of charging on her iPhone.The laser pointer and flashlight are both bonus features that I don't see myself using that often, but the same situations that require an emergency charger also call for a flashlight, so that's a benefit.  Read the manual as others have stated, the procedure for turning on the separate features isn't exactly instinctive.
1492, I have read all the Flashman books and this is an excellent story. If you have read any of the others you will know what to expect and if you have not, this is a good place to start. I would recommend you begin at the beginning simply so you will get all the back story, but that is not necessary.Just pick it up and enjoy it for its simple lighthearted fun. That is something we do not get enough of these days. There is no grand lesson here, although you will learn things you did not know before, but the intent of the book is simply to entertain and you will be entertained.Don't worry if it could have happened or didn't or if the time periods are correct to the year and month. Just enjoy Harry Paget Flashman at his best or would that be worst.
1493, "Urgh a Music War" and I think the US Festival also featured The Police at their most hectic.In my opinion, it sounds better than it looks (although the female singers are a foreshadowing of solo Sting). I kind of wished they could have reedited it (is it me or are does the extra audio and video footage look and sound better than the concert itself?), but it's nowhere as dizzying as Cream's Farewell concert. But it's still great to see this on DVD after all these years.Sting and Police fans must have this one, but they really should push for "Police Around The World" even more so.
1494, Thank God I've inherited this masterpiece by Marvin Gaye. This is indeed one of the greatest albums I've ever heard.I used to listen to this album over and over again during my bus rides and displayed the infectious impact it had on me using hand signals and other movements to the relative music (nobody got hurt because of that).Featured on "What's Going On" are solemn, reflective, spiritual, realistic, cordial and motivating moods. A blase album.Even though this shouldn't be the sole determinant of getting this Marvin Gaye piece, "What's Going On" ranked at #6 of Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.
1495, ...and when you consider that the "orchestra," featured all too prominentally, were all "union" - it's a miracle this was ever made.  Still: seeing Ringo dressed as Frank Zappa; Flo and Eddie do...well, anything; and - ESPECIALLY, when Flo and Eddie yammer "You dare t'suck the fringe offa Jimmy Carl Black," JC Black (an ex-drummer, as he said "the Indian of the group" - listen to your "We're Not In It For The Money" CD) performs "Lonesome Cowboy Burt."  If you've seen it, nothing else need be said...except, maybe "PLOT?" PPFFFFFFFtttttttttt!!!However, a quote from the book "Groucho, Harpo, Chico, and sometimes Zeppo" is especially "pertinent" here: "....collect enough insanity in one place and sometimes the 'S' falls out."  Hey, just dig the music and don't intellectualize.
1496, It was hard to bring myself to read another Jack Ryan novel, especially one as thick as book is. It was a daunting and adventurous feeling before I delved into the book.I was honestly expecting much more action in Vietnam. If you have pictures of Huey helicopters on the cover, I'm expecting some good portion of this book to take place in Vietnam. However, most of the book is set in the streets hunting down and killing drug dealers (1 rightousness point!). Unprotected sex with an escaped prostitute (-1 logic point). Training with soldiers in the country (1 cool point). One car chase (-1 cliche point)Considering the length of the book, I expected more. I'd say this is a substandard Clancy book. I want more military and less "ex-solider" kind of stuff.
1497, Marvin Gaye was a great singer who lived from 1939-1984. He had a tremendous vocal ability that allowed him to sing sweet soul music, politically-aware commentaries, hard funk, disco-ish stuff and eco-friendly classics all with equal conviction. As a boy in 1985 I remember TWO tribute songs to him that charted in the US Top 10 - a measure of the esteem in which he and his music was held. As one of the original Motown artists, he helped to define the golden era of mid-60's pop music, and trumped even this with his great album What's Going On in 1971.This superb anthology from the Motown vaults is packed with great songs, and I have been a big fan of this record since discovering it in 2001. I cannot recommend this more highly to those Amazon shoppers who may yet be unaware of this great vocalist.By the way, these Motown Anthology 2CD sets are not to be missed. Try out The Supremes and The Temptations also in this series.5 stars!!
1498, I just finished reading Red Mars and was so disappointed. This book had so much potential going into it, but in short the characters suck. The main characters in Red Mars are all part of the first 100 people to colonize Mars. You don't get to meet all 100 of them (thank god), but out of the ones you do meet there is not one of them that is likeable. This lack of any characters to get attached to or even like a little makes reading Red Mars a painful experience. There are some good ideas about Mars, the technology to live there, and ways to terraform it all presented from characters that are just not enjoyable.
1499, I loved this book and it remains one, if not THE favourite CLANCY book I've read. It is a lot smaller in scale to the rest of his novels and thats why I think I like it so much. It was such an easy read compared to the brick-like Executive Orders, and the tension is stratospherically high at the end of the book - but in a good way (unlike the pain-staking ending of SUM OF ALL FEARS where you just want to reach in and beat The President and his National Security Advisor to death for being so dumb for soooo long)!!!The beauty about this book is that you dont have to have read any other Clancy book before either. It's totally self contained and thats the way I like it.
1500, I have been using two of these battery tenders for my Yamaha snowmobiles for 2 years  now. I leave them plugged in all the time. The batteries are always fully charged, and have never had a worry about not having full battery when I need it, regardless of how cold it got. I would purchase again no question about it.10/11/12 Update, just purchased 2 more I love them so much. Have left the previous 2 on the snowmobiles, and now have one on lawn tractor, and the other new one on the CAN-AM Spyder.
1501, This is the WORST transfer of a movie that I have ever seen.  Does Twentieth Century Fox know what was done with this movie?  They released it originally but I guess they are not responsible for the devastation that has ensued.  It is so poorly done that there are wavy lines at times and the color goes in and out.  It was supposed to be a digital transfer but it is a travesty.  This should never have been allowed to be released.  The original company that did this, CCM, should be severely chastized for even thinking about putting their name on it!
1502, I have purchased 4 pair of pants from gap, ll bean and columbia.  The columbia pants are way too tight.  They say 32W, but I couldn't even button them.  The other 3 pants fit fine, I need a belt in fact.  I don't understand how they can say they are a 32W when matching them up to other pants I purchased and own they are easily 3-5 inches shorter in the waist.The difference for the next sizes up with the same length some how increases the price of the pants by $20!  forget it, returning and will not buy from columbia again.
1503, My big problem with this film is that it simply does not flow. It's like a composition that meanders all over the place and does not fully explore any thesis. Characters do things which one simply wouldn't do in real life. If I was a graduate student at Oxford, I surely wouldn't drop the "F" bomb on a Don whom I want to become my mentor. Romantic relationships appear "out of the blue." Some characters disappear into thin air and the plot is so disjointed that I felt the whole thing was a waste of time. It's a pity because the trailer looked good and Lenora Watling is certainly easy to look at, but Elijah Wood is just plain HORRIBLE and quite frankly, other than her looks, Ms. Watling doesn't impress much either. Hurt spends his time pontificating and the whole thing is a jumble. Don't bother with it.
1504, This was the first and last Robinson book I read. Too many geographical details- the characters were unsympathetic and the story line lacked creativity. I guess I should have read one of the other colored Mars first. However, I thank Robinson from sparing me from the desire to read any more of them- my time on Earth is limited. If I were you, your time on Mars should be limited, too. This was also the last science fiction genre that I read- it made me realize that it's not for me, and for that, I also thank the author.
1505, I'm not sure I would call the fragrance, basil, but it has a wonderful herbal smell that I love.  While it isn't overwhelming, the fragrance stays on your hands for a while after you dry them.  I'll probably try the dish soap in the basil next.I've been buying Mrs. Meyers products for several years and love to buy them by the case on Amazon because the price is more reasonable and I don't have to worry about running out for a while.  I've also used the Geranium, Lemon Verbena and Lavender and love them all.You can't go wrong with Mrs. Meyers products and will probably want to try more of their cleaning products after you experience this one.
1506, RainX makes a washer fluid... but you already have fluid in your washer system.  Your dealership and service centers are both likely to top-off your washer fluid reservoir whenever you bring them the vehicle, but they won't be using expensive fluid.  Tossing a few ML of this in your washer fluid reservoir will give you the benefits of the expensive RainX washer fluid.Pro:-Makes water bead up and roll off your windshield.-Plenty of product in the bottle, enough for several cars, or a great many top-offs.-Relatively inexpensive.-Requires effectively zero maintenance.-Great way to doctor-up / re-treat an already hydrophobic window.-Works with any automobile.Con:-Not free?-Maybe not as effective as the RainX washer fluid? Cannot confirm, have not performed a solid test.-Still not as effective a proper hydrophobic treatment for the glass, a la traditional RainX or Glass Science.
1507, Great graphics and game play. Solid instructions on how to play. Interface is very clean and user friendly. Not a negative comment to make for the application itself. I am not so good at the game yet, so it is a challenge for me to play with some level of command. For such a simple concept, the level of strategy required is very high. Its one of those games that is easy to learn, a lifetime to master. Solid 5-star recommendation for both graphics and gameplay. GO GO GO...Other titles from this publisher share similar graphic quality and game play...check them out!
1508, I read a lot of science fiction, and typically enjoy books that work in good hardcore science, be it real, theoretical, or fantastical.  This book manages to come up with a few of each.  There is a great deal devoted to the science of terraforming mars into human habitable environment, and the process of human surviving in the harsh enviroment that exists today.  Honestly though, Robinson would have done better writing a non-fiction essay on Mars habitation than this poor effort at a fictional story.The characters and plot lines are blurry and disinteresting.  Time takes decades long leaps, with little warning and it became confusing and tedious.I had to force myself to finish it, and there is little danger of my reading the next two books in the series, or anything else from Robinson for that matter.
1509, This novel was written during a period when Clancy was in &quot;The Zone.&quot;  This novel provides the reader with a background of a character that we know from previous novels as John Clark.  Clark, an ex-Navy Seal, who possesses a great deal of intelligence and ice water in his veins when confronted with evil.  He shows absolutely no remorse and offers no apologies for exterminating the criminals who wreak havoc on society.  This is a very dark novel with extremely graphic descriptions of gratuitous violence coupled with excessive profanity.  However, the book is also a great yarn with intricate sub-plots and places the reader in the midst of the action that took place during the Viet Nam War era.  What's interesting is that Jack Ryan, son of a homicide detective, makes a cameo appearance as a college senior and discusses career options with his dad.A shame that this book was never made into a movie.  It would have been awesome.
1510, The Mauritius Command is a first rate piece of historical fiction.  Patrick O'Brian deftly weaves this swashbuckling nautical tale into the historical account of the British retaking the Mauritius Islands. Lucky Jack Aubrey, with a little help from Stephen Maturin, becomes a Commodore and leads his squadron of ships into battle with the French.A new father, Jack Aubrey leaves behind his wife to venture out to the Indian Ocean.  His wife, Sophie, lost her dowry and story begins with Jack hurting for money.  So the opportunity to have command and be back on full pay is most welcome.  Commodore Aubrey's command is complicated by the personalities of his subordinate commanders.  Maturin comes out of the closet and works his espionage in the open.With victory just within his grasp, Admiral Bertie arrives to take command and the credit away from Jack.  Despite that setback, Lucky Jack stills finishes on top.I highly recommend this book.
1511, The film is old, and the cinematography dated; however, we are fortunate to have such a vibrant Violetta. Without such films, we become jaded by the stylized, and often leaden, performances of today. We also need a sense of history. This film gives us a point of departure from which we can understand other interpretations of the opera. Anna Moffo is clearly a more believable Violetta than we are likely to find today. Her looks are distinctive, fitting with the character, not like the emotionally barren performances of most sopranos these days.
1512, Although I didn't like my CallPod Dragon bluetooth headset, I love this CallPod Charger.  I started running out of places to charge my multiple gadgets at night, each one wanting is own outlet.  With this unit, I charge two cell phones, my bluetooth headset, two Ipods, and I still have room for expansion.  Best of all, I only have to tie up a single outlet.My only complaint is that I would like to be able to turn off all the little LEDs for each connected device.  At night, my bedroom ceiling glows blue due all those LEDs.
1513, What a gorgeous nightgown this was.  It fit beautifully and was so feminine and lovely. Unfortunately, it was misadvertised under cotton nightgowns, but it was nylon, and nylon doesn't breathe and is hot to sleep in.  I reluctantly sent it back, knowing I'd roast in it at night. It was sold by an outside merchant who charges a restocking fee, and arm wrestles you a little about it. So from now on, I'm only going to buy straight from Amazon, where they don't hastle you on returns and refund the whole amount, and pay the postage.
1514, Stevie Wonder, as a composer, singer, and musician was simply at a creative peak during the 70's. I would recommend anything he put out during that decade.'Songs in the key of life' is one Stevie's most accessible, and at the same time innovative albums. Like the albums that came before it (innervisions, talking book, etc) SITKOL strikingly combines an optomistic driving groove with some of the sharpest social and political criticism you will find in popular music.Some of the better known tunes are "sir duke", 'I wish', 'isnt she lovely', and 'as' - but the other tracks are all good!
1515, As the title for this 1996 CD suggests, the more mid-tempo/ballad side of Mr. Gill are given more prominent on this release. Now this wouldn't be a problem if these songs were of the quality that we are used to on afore mentioned CDs by Johnny. What we have here are some half decent songs, that whilst not awful, are a par down on what we are used to from this artist. On to many of these songs, they all merge into each other. Only a hardcore fan/lover of quiet storm moment would fine anything of any value here. I never had my copy for long, giving it to my big Sister, who loved all things Johnny back then.As for the more the more up-tempo songs, 'I know you Want me is OK' as is 'So gentle'.This was the last Johnny Gill Cd I purchased( and I think that this was his last major solo CD release) With a voice like Mr. Gill has, this is a crying shame!
1516, bought h500 and was defective, motorola replaced extremely quickly, must of been out out h5oo cause they sent me the h710.  Was very easy to set up with my t-mobile dash.  lasts forever, good sound - lack of ear plug a big plus.when washed this one by accident replaced with h721 cause only version i could find local, would have replaced with h710 if i could have found it.uses micro usb charger and not mini like the dash but you can get adaptor so u can  charge with same charger.
1517, I recently bought a "juice pack" for my iPhone 4, and it takes the micro A USB cord. They are not too common, and the cord furnished with the battery pack is extremely short. The Nokia CA-101 was a better length, and it was in the PRIME area.Pros:Syncs with iTunes on the iMacGreat companion in the carSolid construction; not cheaply madeCons:Cord will slip out of the juice pack battery with no-noticeNever have enoughStrong, and long enough to use in case of a zombie attackhighly recommend
1518, It is Friday , 8-17-12 . This disc is selling for only 4.99 from Amazon . Man this is a GROOVING and killin' recording . Bob James provided the arrangements and is in on electric piano . Erig Gale plays some of the finest guitar of his great career as well . The whole album is amazing , but the title song grabbed me by the spinal column as i was delivering yesterday . I must have listened to the tune MISTER MAGIC , like , fifteen times . This was one of the early albums i heard that really shoved me into jazz . It's the sort of record that can make you much less interested in popular music , if you're inclining that direction . Truly magical and sublime . Seek it out .
1519, Recently swapped out my old cabin air filter for this new Wix cabin air filter. When I slid out the old cabin air filter it was covered in dust and leaves from the fall (disgusting). Seriously people change these things out at the start of every winter, you'll be glad you did. The new filter slide right in the factory housing and fit perfectly. Snapped it back in place and bam, done in five minutes. Watch YouTube for videos on how to do this it saves you at least $60 that the dealer would tack on for labor and markup on the filter.
1520, I couldn't say All Eyez on Me is Pac's number 1 best work but it ranks pretty high with Makaveli,me against the world,and 2pacaplypse now. I still think its a classic. The production on these cds were great but Pac lyrics have became a little bit lazy but he redeems himself on Makaveli. Disc 1 has a whole bunch of classics,the only song I wasn't really feeling was How do u want it.Disc 2 had some fillers like Ratha b ya Nigga or Check out time but was still pretty good. I just wish he had more conscious tracks like he did before he joined death row records.But overall a must get for any Pac fan.
1521, The Good: The headset pairs well with the iPhone 3G and 3G S.  The controls on the headset work very well (A2DP with AVRCP).  For music, I could play, pause, fast forward and rewind easily (great for listening to audio books).  For talking, you can answer calls from the headset without having to press anything on the phone.  The stereo sound is great when you plug in the second earpiece.  The in-ear Noise Isolation ear-buds are comfortable and work well.The Bad: The noise reduction cuts off outgoing speech, so people were constantly asking me to repeat what I said.  This was the deal-breaker for me because I am always talking on the headset.  If Plantronics could fix this, the headset would be perfect!
1522, And here's why...Its his most accessible by far. I had learned about John Clark in reverse, my perceptionwas that he was just another cold blooded killer, a machine programmed to do the biddingof the CIA. This tells his story with great compassion and sensitivity and thats why thisis my #1 Clancy thriller of all time.Gone are the laborious details of submarines, fighters, tanks, etc. that so many yearn for,what we have is an old fashioned story of love and revenge. And boy does Clancy get the revengepart right. Somewhat implausible for purists, but come on people, this is a fast, gripping,and highly satisfying feast of methodical payback! Just the way its supposed to be. A mustread.
1523, Innervisions, from 1973, is Stevie Wonder's best album to me. I first heard it in 1982, during a time when some songs from that album got some renewed interest. But some 23 years later, this album still is my favorite, its emotional, personal and even social themes very dominant.  From Too High, where Stevie sings about a woman so very high on drugs and disillusioning everyone, to Visions and its moving lyrics to Living in the City and a person's quest for survival in it and Golden Lady, a special tribute to women, this album has it. It also has the funky Higher Ground, of which the Red Hot Chili Peppers made a nice remake of it. This is Stevie's best album to me. Not even Songs In the Key Of Life, Hotter Than July, In Square Circle, Talking Book, Conversation Peace, or Characters (which I also love) can top this wonderful piece of art.
1524, I've just finished reading "Without Remorse" and greatly enjoyed learning more about the character John Kelly, AKA John Clark.  The story is set in 1970 during the height of the Vietnam Conflict, and John Kelly is trying to re-establish a life outside of the armed services after several life shattering tragedies.  Despite finding some civilian friends, Kelly is largely angered and aloof from life and all it's unfairness.  He finds purpose in life by taking matters into his own hands to punish evil-doers both here stateside and once again is the jungles (or is it rain forests?) of southeast Asia.This book was published in 1993 and will remain a timeless Clancy masterpiece.
1525, I LOVE this gate and would buy it again. I like how it swings open both ways, opens with a foot pedal so it's hands free, and is incredibly sturdy though it's pressure-mounted. My ONLY disappointment with this gate is that it doesn't fit well on our stairs. We live in a small apartment and the wall doesn't jut out far enough from the bottom step in order for the foot pedal to work. Instead, I mounted the gate in the doorway of our baby's nursery, and it is working out GREAT.
1526, I bought this headset in Aug 08.  Initially, I really liked it. The size was small and it is very light.  It fit in my ear really well.  It seemed to work fine for about a month or 2, and then I began having complaints that people couldn't understand me.  The problem is this: To have the volume up loud enough to hear anyone caused my outgoing voice to be so loud that it made my speech sound slurred.  Also, this headset didn't manage background noise well as I often had complaints.  Callers sometimes complained of an echo tooThe unfortunate truth is that I received so many complaints that I had to get rid of the head set after only 4 months. What a waste of money!(Incidentally, I replaced this headset with the Plantronics Voyager 510.  After 1 month of usage, I like it alot!  Callers can hear me clearly and I can hear them well.  It also eliminates a great deal of background noise.)
1527, I bought this watch for my wife who needed a new one. She was pleased with the "Indiglo" feature---the dial lights up with electroluminescent coating --I guess like the fire flies glowing with the same mechanism. I found this watch in Macy's among the usual bunch of Timex pieces, kept on open counters.The watch is nicely designed and does not look cheap like many other less expensive Timex pieces found in several stores.The dial is elegant . The only limitation is that the date window is very tiny and is hard for reading. The metal band is convenient and should last a long time. I presume that Timex uses Chinese quartz movements and should be suitable for a watch for daily use in this price range--that is less than $50.
1528, Mine arrived perfect, simple to open packaging, and works as expected. Easy to use and comes with clamps and permanently installed wires if desired. This does not delufate, nor start a car, and at low amps would take weeks to recharge a drained battery, deep-cycle AGM or Gel type, as this is a very low amp trickler/float charger. Most AGM's require a special 3-4 staged 10-30 amp charger. Once the battery is charged this will do its job of tending/maintaining a full charge on any 12 volt DC lead-acid battery. I also have two Battery MINDers for our RV and towed that are garaged over the winter and a Tender plus for a truck. You need close access to an outlet or a properly sized extension cord and you can leave the battery attached, in the vehicle. I recommend this, would buy again, and hope this helps someone.
1529, For the price, it's a good product. The non-waterproof version smears like crazy on me, I can't even wear it, but this waterproof stuff held up even through major sweating, so I'll give credit where credit's due.  It doesn't thicken like crazy, it doesn't lengthen like crazy, but it just gives you a nice, solid lash line.  For a regular makeup-wearer, this is a nice casual, weekend, no-makeup look mascara.  For my day-to-day mascara, I prefer something with a little more oomph, but for casual weekend wear, and for the price, this is a good value.
1530, I specifically bought this because I thought that it would come in blue, which seems like its the official color of my car. It came in red, which is the only COMPLAIN I have about the brush.Now it does a great job of cleaning the snow with the brush, the ice scraper shaves ice off just fine, it didn't snap off on me even when it was below 10 degrees outside, and the grip is nice. The brush itself is very long, and when I sit in the drivers seat, i can actually clean the side view passenger side mirror with it when I roll my window down. So its a lazy man's tool at that rate too!
1531, As a life long fan of Teena's music, this album ranks a strong 4th on my personal favorite list.  I love this artist because she is truly an original who took her varied musical loves and melded them into her own style - still a courageous feat in the music biz. This fact alone is why her fan base is so loyal & fanatical, because she stays true to HERSELF and doesn't cater to the newest latest trends.My personal faves on this disc are: Irons in the Fire, Tune In Tomorrow (this was one of the first jazz influenced songs that I truly dug), I Need Your Lovin', You Make Love Like Springtime & Young Love.What's funny about Teena's music is that although heavy on the horns & synths, her music never sounds dated or classified to one era, it's truly timeless - I'm still listening to this album that was released almost 20 yrs ago like it was just released last week!!
1532, At first I thought this tub was ridiculously big, but my son loves it! I think it's so clever that you can have the baby in a lying down or sitting up position, depending on which way you put him in--this product is very durable and made to last until your child outgrows it! We even bought a second one for our summer house, because I can't imagine giving him a bath without it. My son is 9 1/2 months old and can sit up perfectly, but still prefers to "lounge" in it lying down. I put it on my kitchen island and bath him that way, so I don't kill my back in the bathroom. I also like that it's all plastic, no mesh or rubber mats that can mildew--it has a bump in the middle to keep the baby from sliding.
1533, When watching this, we get to see Pink Floyd just before their success of Dark Side of the Moon.  This isn't necessarily like a concert video though because there isn't any crowd.  Rather, this was created with the purpose of putting some images to the music.  We get to see the band perform, so that's good.  There are a few times when the filming would focus on quick cuts, superimposition of images, and dissolves let the music act as the background to the image.  Since I've never seen the band in concert (and most likely never will) I would have liked to see the acutal Men more than their electrical equipment during Echoes.
1534, We're All Devo! is the second home video release by new wave band Devo. Released on VHS and Laserdisc in 1984, We're All Devo! is a collection of Devo music videos from 1976 to 1983.Like The Men Who Make the Music, We're All Devo! has a storyline to tie the videos together. In it, the character of Rod Rooter is reviewing Devo's music videos for Big Entertainment. Much to his chagrin, his daughter Donut Rooter (Laraine Newman) is a fan of the band. Donut discovers the videos after asking her father for money to get an abortion (though this is not explicitly stated).Track ListingJocko Homo(I Can't Get No) SatisfactionThe Day My Baby Gave Me A SurpriseGirl U WantFreedom Of ChoiceWhip ItThrough Being CoolBeautiful WorldLove Without AngerThat's GoodPeek-A-BooDr. DetroitA Worried Man (from the film Human Highway)
1535, The Diaper Genie is great.  It helps eliminate diaper odors, thanks to the slightly powder scented bags, and that it seals off each dirty diaper.  It's convenient,  VERY easy to use, and most of all sanitary.  We'll have this thing filled to the gills with dirty diapers, and you wouldn't even know that any stinky diapers were in the baby's room!  When it is filled, just turn the knob to cut the bag, tie off, throw out, and start all over again with fresh clean bags!
1536, This is the first Dickies product I could remember buying and after searching on Amazon they seemed like the best looking out of all the brands. I mean, after all, why buy designer overalls? So when I got home from work and tried them on I was very pleased that the fit was perfect and the material, clasps, buttons and so on are all really good quality. I can see these lasting me a good many years and as soon as they are done tumble drying I'm going to wear them out to our favorite cajun restaurant tonight for some crawfish and gumbo. They will look great with a long sleeved jersey, then a  long sleeved 3-button thermal Henley over that and of course my white Converse Chuck Taylor Hi-Tops! I love my new Dickies Overalls from Amazon and you will too!
1537, I already reviewed the SACD version of this album, but I might as well do the DVD as well.  Especially since they keep pushing it.  Anyways.....This was a very cool concert, I wish I could have been to Berlin in person to see it when it occurred but oh well.  Anyways, it is very well put together.  Roger managed to assemble a good supporting cast (shame he couldn't assemble the other members of Floyd).  I can certainly understand why Pink Floyd did a very limited release in its first iteration.The DVD itself is a very good transfer.  Anywas, Floyd needs to release the other stuff on DVD...
1538, This bag really surprised me!  I bought it to store my electric toothbrush in because toothbrush holders aren't large enough. I figured I'd have to put it in diagonally because it is so large, but it fits perfectly!  I was able to put a lot of miscellaneous items from under my bathroom sink, so it isn't all cluttered in there anymore. I'm going to get more of these bags to organize the rest of my bathroom items, then probably even some of my other cupboards and closets!  I love it!!!  I am sure it would be great for taking on trips, too, and it's so easy to organize your things in the pocket, so that it all looks good.
1539, How I wish I could say five stars... The concert I went to in Dallas was unquestionably five stars (getting the overall effect washing over you, I suppose).  I'm no director or editor, but not spending much time visually on the jet-fueled percussionist in the fantastic drum cage is just wrong; his playing was integral and entrancing! I waited with bated breath for that transcendent moment when life is utter zen -- The giant floating all-seeing pig spinning to "Run Like Hell".  The video shows little of that, so that culmination of audio and visual experience is rather missed.  Still, what really spins, is the music and special effects, including the timeless video within the video. Pink Floyd themselves goes all out for you, no holds barred.
1540, Every Musical Genuis Has his Masterpiece. With Prince it was Sign &quot;O&quot; the times. With Michael Jackson it was thriller and with stevie wonder its songs in the key of life. I have Never Heard an Album anything on this earth like this. Stevie Wonder Knows what the human heart feels. Every inch of this album is musicaly and artistically Perfect. This is even better then Innervisions Another phenomenal Album by wonder. From Pasttime Paradise to probably the Greatest song Ever written &quot;Love's in need of love today&quot; Stevie Wonder is the dreamer of dreams and knows what love!, Pain., and heart ache feels like. My Advice with Songs in the key of life is Buy it! i promise you will dance , sing and Cry with this perfect piece of musical HIStory. God bless steveland Morris
1541, This album is Lionel Richie's third solo and was a best-seller like its two predecessors,Richie's '82 self-titled debut and '83's CAN'T SLOW DOWN. On this CD,there are 5 bonus tracks following track 8 which is SAY YOU SAY ME. One of them is an outtake(track 9 which didn't appear on the original 1986 release) and the other four are alternate versions of some songs from the original track line-up. The title track really rocks. SE LA,DEEP RIVER WOMAN and BALLERINA GIRL are cool. LOVE WILL CONQUER ALL is a smooth groove. SAY YOU SAY ME is from the 1985 Columbia film WHITE NIGHTS. That song was released as a single and made its radio debut in November 1985(it first appeared on the WN soundtrack). The other songs are good. After this album,Richie stayed out the studio for six years due to financial troubles and an on-the-rocks marriage that would end in divorce.
1542, I enjoyed this book.  Clancy contrasts very well the mood evoked by the Chesapeake Bay (for those of us who know it) with that of the mean streets of Baltimore.  I enjoyed the 2-level plot, wherein Kelly is dealing with  drug-dealing dirt-bags on the one hand, and his mission to Vietnam on the  other. The plot was realistic--the professional manner in which Kelly  carries out his dual missions was, I thought, very thoroughly thought out  and presented. I enjoyed also his portrayals of the American and Russian  spooks, and the Russian Air Force colonel.  My main complaint with Clancy's  writing occurs when he's trying to convey tender love thoughts towards the  women in Kelly's life--too much syrup (of the corn type). I don't think  that subject is Clancy's forte'. Otherwise, this would make a great movie,  as good as &quot;Clear and Present Danger&quot;.
1543, This canvas duffle bag is well constructed out of tough, heavy duty material.  It closes on top, not with a zipper but with a metal loop.  The loop is on one side and grommets on the three other sides.  Put the metal loop through the grommets by folding down the sides and secure by using the hook on the strap.  I've never used such a closure, but it's effective.This is a well made bag.  I imagine it can take a beating.  Great for camping.  I bought it for a tent, but the tent is huge and just a tad too big for this bag.  I was able to squeeze it in, though.  It works.
1544, First off these things are soft as hell on the inside and it feels great wearing them. Downside, I am 6 foot tall 190 lbs with a 31 inch waist. I ordered the 32x32 and the problem is that I had to cut off the adjustment hardware all together just to make them fit. They were riding a little high on the boys if you know what I mean. With the adjustment things removed they work just fine for me. I would say order a 34x34 or 34x32 but then they are going to be a bit long and it might not add any extra strap length. So tall lean muscular guys or gals? Be repaired to do some minor modifications. I bought these as a joke, since I am from Alabama and everyone out west thinks this is what everyone back home wears. Now I am in love though and I wear them often.
1545, i got this because i remember all my buddies from athens loved these guys, and had played me songs on occasion because i was the resident drummer and this is the resident favorite band of indie rock drummers. why? because damon che, drummer and band leader, is a crazed lunatic with mad skills and forearms the size of florida and the yucatan peninsula, respectively. it's all hardcore-ish math/art/experimental/prog rock. basically. all you need to know is that it's a bunch of noise with some absolutely phenomenal drumming thrown in.
1546, What a joy to hear Stevie's early music tied to his Motown era. Thia album contains some of his best if not some of the all time greatest Motown joints ever in "My Cherie Amor" and "Yester-Me, Yester-You, Yesterday." The clarity of Stevie's voice underscores the simple but effective writing on lesser known gems like "The Shadow Of Your Smile" and "Hello Young Lovers." And I must be totally honest and admit I bought the album largely because of "Angie Girl" maybe my favorite pre Tamla Wonder song. Although a little long in the tooth with some fluff (he could have kept the hideous cover of The Doors "Light My Fire) this is an enjoyable selection from the formative years of Stevie's stellar resume.
1547, I ordered the pink suede shoe...ShoeMagoo via Amazon....BIG MISTAKE.  The fake Bandolino arrived in a brown box,..not the Bandolino shoe box I usually get....the shoe is faded pink.almost like dirty cotton candy. Then I'm comparing the shoe to another shoe I have (same style different color) shoe is visible short, uneven, faded and the peep toe is uneven.This clearly was a fake Bandolino shoe from Shoe Magoo. Shoe Magoo has a note in the box that tells you never contact Amazon for order issues contact Shoe Magoo...umm no that was a red flag right there. Needless to say the fake filthy shoe that had been glued together with school childrens glue was returned. I contacted Amazon and they apologized for the sellers poor quality.
1548, Alistair Maclean, known most for "Where Eagles Dare" and "The Guns of Navarone," is one of the best writers in the WWII spy thriller genre.  "Partisans" is lesser known but still very good. This book is set in Italy and the former Yugoslavia during WWII  The story will likely be confusing to most people since the history and politics of the former Yugoslavia is unknown to most.  Yugoslavia officially sided with the Axis powers but had a large rebel force known as partisans who fought against the Axis.  There is also the dynamic of the Italian-German alliance which was strained, especially towards the end of the war.  All this background makes for much intrigue and suspense.  This is an entertaining and fast moving novel, if a little confusing.

1551, Although I have had Dickies in the past, the quality of the sewing around the zipper was bad.  After only wearing these to work for the second time, I noticed the stitching was coming apart where the zipper cover was.  It looked as if my zipper was open at the top.  The pants were not small, as a matter of fact I thought a 36" waist would have been more appropriate after I tried on the 38", but decided to keep the 38 in case of shrinkage.  Anyway, I ended up stitching the seam myself, and now all is well, the comfort and easy care of the work pants are fine.
1552, I bought this to use in my hair but also use it on my skin as well. It has no smell that I can decern. It arrived cloudy and semi-solid. My first thought was that the stuff was defective After looking this up online, it turns out that is normal when it is below room temperature (it was a cold day). Just holding the bottle in my hand made it turn to an oil again.When my hair was a little longer, I would sometimes use a couple of drops in it to a little more manageable and give it that feel of not having been washed for a day or so. I'd imagine that using more would make a nice treatment for hair if you weren't going anywhere and could wash it out later.After getting my hair cut short I started trying it on my skin, and it makes a really nice, non greasy moisturizer. A little goes a long way.
1553, When I was a brand-new mom, eager to color-coordinate my baby's nursery, I bought terrycloth changing pag covers in almost every shade available. Good thing I bought so many, because each time baby oozed, leaked, squirted, spit up, fountained, or otherwise made a baby mess, I would have to carefully fit the straps back through the strap holes, then remove the pad cover, toss it in the wash, and put a new cover on. Doesn't sound like much work, but considering how many messes babies can make, changing the pad gets to be almost a daily chore. On top of that, the terrycloth just doesn't clean well, even with those special baby-stain removers and even with Shout! It's much easier (and less costly and less stressful and less time consuming) to use the bare changing pad and simply wipe down any messes with diaper wipes or with a gentle cleanser. Don't waste your money buying pad covers.
1554, I've never done serious over-the-road trucking, but I've driven hundreds of thousands of miles around the U.S., fairly often pulling the kind of marathons that Josh Spiller and his trucker buddies do.  The American road  is a world of its own, and I've read few books that capture it.  Muriel  Gray really nails it, which is surprising given that she's from Scotland.  She mentions in the acknowledgements that she took a cross-country trip  with a trucker as part of her research.  She was obviously paying  attention.As for the rest, the characters are believable, the plot moves  right along, and it's nice to read a good novel about America where the  characters are working class.  This is popular fiction, not serious  literature, but it's a darn good read.
1555, I really like the ease of use of this app once it's set up. It is wonderful that for major accounts you can import your own billing information and see monthly bills as they come. That being said, in order to use the pay feature to pay bills, the costs are high (over 2%) and they build in a 3-4 day waiting period, which can impact your budget timing. I felt this was excessive on both counts and chose to pay bills my regular way,then refresh the app to show the bills have been paid. Overall, I'm very pleased with the app.
1556, Sometimes when you buy a nice pair of dress shoes, they'll throw in a pair of wood shoe trees. I have a few from Men's Wearhouse that were comped, but I needed a few more pair so I purchased these Woodlore's off Amazon.They are well-made and the rope loops are a nice feature to assist in removing the tree from the shoe. My only complaint would be that the trees came very dusty with cedar dust/saw dust, and I needed to really rub them down with a sock before sticking them in my dress shoes. Still, it's a minor issue. These are real cedar, made in the U.S.A., and are less than 1/10th the cost of a new pair of dress shoes (which is what you'll need if you don't take good care of your dress shoes) so I'm happy with the product overall.
1557, Seems as if the * of the show is David Gilmour? How about a little more footage for the rest of the band instead of 90% Gilmour & the three girls? I thought Mason & Wright could rock-on a lot more than they did with this concert. Gilmore seemed pretty restrained too. Is it an age thing? Is Santana the only 60's rocker with any youthful energy left?Also, guess I'm old school as the production is too MTV'ish for my tastes. Less fancy lighting with thoses aggravating 1 seconds clips and more/ longer shots of the musicians (besides Gilmour & the three girls, please)! Their performance seemed almost too polished without much movement for most of the concert. Maybe it will grow on me, but it's nothing like their early 70's "Live at Pompeii" tape. I rest my case.
1558, I have used these through one Missouri winter and I don't see how you can slip with these on ice or snow. Held up great. A life saver literally. My brother in law slipped on the ice and he has had 3 back surgeries and is disabled. I saw these on Amazon and I got them the first chance I got after seeing he's horrible luck, Slip on and off easy when you need them to. Otherwise stay on tight for me.  I got the medium's. Size 10.5 to 11 Mens for me.
1559, I generally go to DXL and wear Harbor Bay shirts and wear 5XLT and can now wear 4XLT comfortably.  That being said I ordered both a 5XLT and 4XLT figuring for the cheap price these are going for that if they did run small that I could wear the bigger one and would soon be able to wear the 4XL.  The 5XL was even a tad bit tight.  Wearable and a little shorter than I'm used to but it's not a tall shirt either.  Just a heads up in case you shop elsewhere and are looking here expect them to be a little smaller than you may be used to, but the price is very nice compared to others.
1560, The bottles are nice but as it is warned in the product, the temperature difference along the cleaning process can make the bottle to brake down. This has happened to me in two out of the three bottles. It is true that I have not been careful enough, waiting for the necessary amount of time for the bottle to cool off before filling it with with cold milk. Nevertheless this problem makes it a little unpractical when you have a little baby and you need to feed him as quick as possible and you are in a hurry. The numbers in the bottles also are difficult to be read.
1561, We used this bath tub with our first son and loved it. It truly  last a lot longer than most and is very safe with infants.However, i just re-ordered one for our second son and had to return it because we now live in a smaller space and it is way too big! If you live in a small place, consider that because it is very large and difficult to store.On a side note, the packaging was beyond awful. the box was damaged, not closed...bad bad bad
1562, I was excited to try this new fragrance from Mrs Meyers since we've used many of her other products.  Parsley?  I thought... what in the world does parsley smell like?  Not sure  this smells like parsley per say, but it has a very nice scent that is not too sweet and smells very fresh and clean.  As a point of reference, I like the geranium and the lemon verbena scents, and really DISLIKE the basil scent as I think it smells too sweet and "perfumey"....This is a great price for these and a really nice product... give it a try, tastes vary, but I like this soap a LOT!
1563, Without Remorse may be my favortie Clancy, though I haven't read that many of his books. It focuses on John Clark, a far-more interesting character than Jack Ryan IMHO, and how he got to the position fans know him in. My only complaint about the book is it's just too long. It's been a while since I read it but I remember reading this thing was like running a marathon. While there isn't anything wrong with lengthy books if everything is necessary but I can't say this is the case for WR. If you're a fan of Clancy, Clark, or the overall Ryan series I would definitely recommend this book.
1564, This was my second disc from Audio Fidelity that I bought and I was blown away again by the clarity, sound stage and punch from this nearly 40 year old recording. I have bought 2 other discs by Music Fidelity and am very pleased with all of them. There is another company that has been remastering discs for a couple of decades which recently have been releasing mediocre remasters. I feel that Audio Fidelity is doing a far better job and they have a great selection of music. I will be getting more of these
1565, I usually enjoy the Flashman books more or less depending on my engagement with their historical content, and generally I'm not big on westerns.  But this was like one of the great Hollywood films in the way it captured the majesty and adventure of the West, with humor and satire sprinkled throughout. In 1849, Flashy participates in the Gold Rush; 27 years later, he returns in time to become the sole white survivor of Custer's Last Stand.  The greatest chase of the entire Flashman series occurs about halfway through, with a murderous Apache war party pursuing Sir Harry across the New Mexican desert.  Reading it, I literally couldn't breathe; when it was over, I choked up over Fraser's sheer storytelling brilliance.  What a writer!
1566, I received the iTorch a few days ago and I have already had to use it.  I love the fact that it is so small and fits in my purse easily.  I like that it uses a USB connection; it makes it easy to charge and so much more versatile.  It charged up fully in about 3 hours after I received it.  It also comes equipped with a laser light and an LED light that are nice add ons.  It comes with a nice little pouch to keep it in so that it doesn't get all scratched up.  I plan on keeping this with me at all times.
1567, I used a turkey baster with measure to take out 16 oz of my coolant then filled radiator back with Purple ice. after a test run around the neighborhood, i touched the coolant hoses and they were HOT, i had no thermometer with me but i check up on the temperature constanly after i do work on my Pathfinder, and the hoses were way hotter then normal. Now this might be counter productive thinking but it makes sense. By having the Coolant increase its temperature, that increase in temperature is going to be direct with the decrease in temperature in the engine block as the coolant's heat transfer ability increases. I have no numbers as of yet, but i know for a fact, this product works even if it might be for 10 or 15 degrees, and for such a low price, Purple Ice has my recomendation.
1568, If you enjoy watching people be odd just for the sake of it - then you might enjoy this, otherwise keep looking for another movie to watch.Good cast - worthless story.Kline plays a prudish bachelor of almost no income, living in a total dump and having fleas - yet he acts like someone with money and sucks up to a wealthy old lady to be included in upper society occasionally. Paul Dano plays an extremely timid loser who rents a cot in Kline's crappy residence. He experiments with cross dressing and has a little crush on Katie Holmes (which goes nowhere). John C Reilly plays a nice but wild and intimidating looking man with a cartoon character type voice.  There really isn't any plot to this story - or any story to this story. Just some odd characters who really aren't interesting at all - especially Dano.
1569, THis was a adult listening top of soul cd. It's about a theme of brotherhood and was not supposed to be a funky release of dancable songs. Instead this is full of ballads and lush arrangements and on that level it is a masterpiece, it's a artist doing something on a different level. It's easy listening but beautiful but it's NOT a dance cd at all. Think a mixture of pop and soul with easy flowing songs and you have this gem.  Plus it has the big  hit 'what's going on' on here as well. Funk fans may not dig this one but you need to broaden your horizons then.
1570, Michael was an incredible child prodigy. These 2 CDs I think summs up the reason why the Jackson 5 were so extremely popular and gives the basis for why he himself became the megastar that he became. I was really taken aback while listening to these songs and just couldn't believe someone so young had that amazing ability. I could have cried when I thought about what he has become and then thought about the reason, this wonderful music and all the hard work he had to do at such a very young age. But moving on, some of my favorites are mostly on the 2nd Cd, Music and Me, One Day in Your Life, Happy, Call on Me and many more. The Jackson 5 classics are I'll Be there, Never can say goodbye and an unknown J5 song, Too Late to change the Time (which is wonderful). This compilation is a must for MJ fans and for anyone that wants to hear some great soul music from Motown.
1571, Our baby's umbilical cord stump fell of when she was just a few days old, so we bathed her in this tub.  She was too tiny for her arms to fit in the arm places, but it worked perfectly because she fit snugly and securely in the place that the body is supposed to go.  Baby won't slip under the water because of the plastic mouldings, so you can have both hands free to wash and reach. Once our baby was big enough to sit up, we put her on the other end (toddler end), and she plays and splashes, while still having the plastic molding so she can't slip back into the water.  She's 18 months old now and we fill the tub to the brim in the big bathtub.  This is a large baby tub, but it stores easily in the bathtub, cleans up very easily, and you will be able to use it for 2 years at least!  Well worth the extra $$.
1572, Acting was good, but the plot was stale and the theme lacked attention grabbing effect. The &#34;theme&#34; gave just Too much detail with the &#34;problems&#34; of everyone!The personal crap got in the way of the plot and made the plot secondary.  If you ever watched a weekday soap-box show, then this movie format was an exact copy!  Very disappointing.  The actors were better than this and their talents never really supported the plot.  Very generous on my part with a &#34;3-star rating&#34;.
1573, ive had the mount for a couple weeks and so far it works great. I read some of the other reviews saying it shakes which i dont know how you could avoid that since the whole car is moving. it hasent fallen down or anything. So far it does what it says. it is cheap but thats to be expected for the price. my only complaint was putting it together was annoying. other then that it really is FINE I sell these at my job that are the same quality for 30$ or more so really its not THAT bad.
1574, The product's good, so I set up an Subscribe & Save for ir, as well as the Regenerist Eye. But it seems that every time I add some other item to my cart, I get a message telling me that the price of these two items has INCREASED since I put them in my cart (on Subscribe & Save).  Today it's already happened... TWICE!  There may be subscribing going on, but the saving part is dwindling to the point that I'm prepared to CANCEL my S&S with Amazon, and just buy it at Costco!
1575, I've been biting my nails on and off ever since I can remember. I was always able to stop by myself by just getting my nails done and painting them. But even with that, I would still use my teeth to chap the nail polish from my nails and then eventually would get back to biting.Mavala Stop tastes really bad. Like, really. So even though I have my nails long, I still use it to keep my hands out of my mouth. It's been helping me a lot, but it does bother me that finger foods are pretty much ruined for me right now. Hopefully I'll be able to break the habit soon and not need it anymore.I recommend this product.
1576, If you're looking for the ultimate impact protection for your BlackBerry Curve, this is the case to have.  Yes, it's bulky and isn't for the pocket phone carrier.  But, if you are a business traveler, field tech, outdoor worker, etc. this is a must-have.  The case fits snugly to the phone all around, allowing normal access to buttons and great protection for the open ports.The holster is much stronger than I expected, with high impact plastic and a strong ratcheting swivel clip.  It stays in place and is easy to slide the phone into without having to look at the holster.  The magnet in the holster also turns off your screen for you to save batteries and prevent accidental button presses.I can throw my phone into my travel bag and not worry.  I have dropped my phone twice since having this case, and I can't even find a mark where the case hit the ground.  OtterBox for the win!
1577, This is an excellent tub. I tried one of the seats first, which pinched my baby and was really uncomfortable. Second I tried another tub, I wish I could remember which one to warn you, but she just kept on slipping down to the bottom of that one despite its "no slip surface".Finally I tried the EuroBath. Never had a problem bathing my daughter in it. Its great for itty bitty babies, big babies, and even small toddlers. I used it all the way until my daughter was large enough to go into the tub herself.Only down side is that its huge. If you lack storage space, this can be annoying, but its definitely worth it.
1578, My Mom has a 2007 accord that fairly well has a motorcycle battery 51R.  I got her one of these because she doesn't drive that car much.My wife makes short trips to work and I bought another for myself to top off her battery if the car sets all weekend which it does sometimes.  It doesn't really need it as much since it has a real car battery but it's helpful.  I have a full sized charger and this one is much easier because you can attach the bolt on  accessory to the battery and just pop the hood and plug it in.  You still get the alligator clip accessory to use on others cars while the bolt on accessory is on the first car.  It's a handy tool and I have had no problems with it.Some people say the HF ones are cheaper as about as good.  I don't know, I never had one,  I know this one works.
1579, These are not expensive pants. Accordingly, while the value is pretty good, don't expect the finest grade of cotton, or an extraordinary fit. Many of the negative reviews of these slacks are unfair because it seems they expected high-grade spun Egyptian cotton and custom tailoring, if that's what you want, go buy it (and expect to pay accordingly).That said, these are nice medium weight khakis that are perfect for movie night or a saturday  outing. The sizing is good. If you're like me, and appreciate a sharp crease, know that these are difficult to iron crisply. ( god save us from 'perma-press!' Keep that treatment, manufacturer, and let us iron our own!)All your pants shouldn't have to be office-wear quality and cut. These are a good second level pair of trousers, and I recommend them as such.
1580, I used some expensive serum that worked very well but I decided to try some cheaper ones to see if they would work the same so I can save some money. Oil of Olay never did anything to my face but since it is an "more expensive" product of this brand so I expect it would be good. Used the whole bottle but nothing happened. Face felt greasy like usual, spots didn't fade away, skin texture has no improvement. In short, nothing happened but not the worst thing I have tried. So I give it a 3 star. I don't think I will buy it again. Will try another brands
1581, I was surprised at just how large this tub was when I received it. Literally, my 3 year old can take a bath in it. He LOVES it, and calls it his "boat". It is really sturdy. it has both positions for infant and toddler, so really can last a long time. If you are NOT looking for something large, this is not the tub for you :-)If you have a smaller infant (which I always do), I would think adding a sponge insert will help to allow even the smallest baby to fit.We love it!
1582, The Xlink BT Bluetooth Gateway is extremely easy to use and set up. Everything should be this easy. You can connect up to three Blueooth enabled cell phones to the unit. Calls are very clear and static free, just be sure you place the unit and your cell phone in an area of your house where you get a good cell phone signal. The more bars, the better. Also, be sure to place your cell phone close to the Xlink, again, the closer the better. All I can say is WOW! One drawback... caller ID will show the phone number but not the callers name. It shows the caller's name as XLink. It could be just my phones though and not the Xlink.
1583, Entertaining enough to pass the time but not very realistic, hence the reason it didn't last but one season. The main characters played by Maura Tierney and Rob Morrow do little to make the show outstanding. Tierney is as good as she is in any other role, but nothing to stand out. Same with Morrow. His character is a bit annoying, which I'm sure is how it was intended. I've made it half way through the only season and it seems every &#34;guilty&#34; verdict so far is reached with no proof or evidence. So, that shows you how weak it really is.
1584, These cushions seem pricey, but they were the only ones we could find to buy, and going without some type of cushion on our brick hearth wasn't an option.  My 11 mo. old daughter started to pull a piece off the other day, but then she gave up and I pushed the piece back down fine.  What I really love about this product is the color of the foam that really blends right in with our living room decor, and the foam can be easily cut to fit perfectly, which we had to do.  My daughter loves to crawl up and sit on the hearth, and in her exuberance she's tumbled off before.  This cushion has directly protected her head a few times.
1585, I had some reservations before buying and subsequently installing this set of blades; however, after all the rain we have had in the past few days I am delighted about buying them.  As above, they work well and git 'er dun.  No noise from rattling.  No smearing from poor wipes.  Just plain clean windows from almost hurricane conditions to almost not needing them.  You cannot help but get that feeling that you made a wise purchase.  Now we will test the blades for ability to withstand the elements more than just the first few days of use.  The previous set of OEM blades lasted 8 years and still have a bunch of life left but are just beginning to show wear.  I hope these last at least half the time.  We'll see.  If not, expect a different story.
1586, I'm not gonna bore you with another long review,but if I was stranded on a desert island and I had only a few discs with me,Stevie Wonder's "Songs In The Key In The Life" would my top choices.So many great songs(Sir Duke,I Wish,Knocks Me Off My Feet,Summer Soft,Isn't She Lovely,As,Another Star,Love's In Need Of Love Today,Ebony Eyes,If It's Magic etc.)with no filler whatsoever.Plus the updated version(supervised by Harry Weinger and remastered by Kevin Reeves at Universial Mastering East)is excellent,with punchy,spacious,vibrant sound and all the original artwork,liner notes and lyrics included.Truly a must-have in every sense of the word!
1587, I just finished A Dance With Dragons, and I just finished reading some of the scathing reviews.  Did these people read the same book I did?  Sure, it isn't as incredible as the first three books in the series, but it was better than A Feast For Crows (which actually gets better after a second read), and head and shoulders above any other fantasy novel produced in the last few years.  I don't understand the critics who say the book doesn't go anywhere.  It goes everywhere!  The action and storylines move along at a nice pace, and there are plenty of cliffhangers to keep readers wanting more.  The only parts of the novel that I got a bit tired of were the Daenerys chapters, set in Meereen.  It's time to start herding all the main characters towards Westeros.  And that's exactly what I think will be happening in The Winds of Winter.  Let's just hope we don't have to wait another 6 years.
1588, As a fan of all things British and especially British TV series, I admit I didn't jump into this one quickly.  I was afraid of its &#34;Little House on the Prairie&#34; veneer.  When a colleague, a philosophy prof, recommended it, I thought I'd give it a shot.  I'm so glad I did!  Like most British drama, the characters---and in this case, ALL of them---are interesting and complex.  Though set in a particular period of British history, the issues addressed by these complex characters are truly timeless and, at the same time, current.  What is amazing is how those issues do not seem to be imposed upon the story line.  They ring true.  This series is particularly important and appealing because of its strong female leads who struggle with issues of independence but the often accompanying loneliness that brings.  I am a fan and I want to be Dorcas Lane when I grow up!
1589, I'm about half way through Red Mars, so this can be only a partial reivew. That said, I find this book compelling, sophisiticated, thoughtful and erudite. The author seems to know a great deal about science, not just the basic chemistry and physics you expect in SciFi authors, but a truly comprehensive grasp of geology. Yet Red Mars is not really about science: It's about people, politics, development and power. A master of character, Robinson does not lack for the descriptive skills of an almost poetic jouranalist, but keeps the story moving with the dramatic tensions arising between characters that changre and eveolve, even as the great Mars settlement experience grows and evolves. In short, one of the best-written books I've read in years: I'm hard-pressed to name its equal.
1590, I HATE...HATE, HATE keeping journals. I have resisted for years...but I really want to lose weight ..so when I found out about this app..I was sceptical.I have now logged in for a month..built a community of others..have it on my phone..my kindle and my computer...so no excuses...I love it and use it every day...and seeing progress really helps me.Yes there are lots of other programs...but it is time to pick one and use it..no excuses.
1591, I installed this on my Audi I keep at a vacation house that only gets driven once a month.  It comes with two battery mounts - clips and a permanant set.  The permanant set installed quickly and easily on the battery - and there is a heavy duty plug witht a cover that I just tuck into the battery holder.  It all looks very clean and "factory installed".  When I leave town I just open the hood an inch - pull out the plug - and plug into the wall unit.  A red light indicates it is charging - green light means it is full.  All very simply and easy to use - and I never have the hassle of jumping the car or having to use another trickle charger.
1592, Speaking as a true Beatle fan who, in my younger days, had a tough time acknowledging that everything the Beatles ever did wasn't perfect, I have to say this is one of the most painful things I've ever seen. But to its credit, you can't NOT watch it once it's on. You're just taken aback by how disjointed and bizarre it is.Seen as separate music videos, the songs all hold up. They're also slightly remixed from the way they eventually appeared on the corresponding album, so that's kinda neat.But did you ever think that the best performance of a song in a Beatles film would be performed by the Bonzo Dog Band? (Interesting that Bonzo Neil Innes would later play Ron Nasty in the Rutles, isn't it?)If you must have this, have somebody buy it for you...
1593, I like working sudoku puzzles whenever I have to wait somewhere, not enough time to get into a book to read but enough time that I need &#34;something&#34; to do.  This app looked like it might be a good fit.  I had downloaded other sudoku games before but they were hit or miss.  I was very happy and felt like I hit the jackpot on this one.  The levels are accurate with many of the books that you can buy and the way that you make notes works very simply and easy to see.I would highly recommend this app to anyone who enjoys these puzzles.
1594, I know that much good has been said if this program and I could repeat almost all of it. It has already helped me lose 4 pounds with very little hassle. My only complaint is that not only does the front facing camera on my kindle make it impossible to add foods by scanning the bar code, but typing in the numbers instead of scanning causes the program to stop running and close. It's easy enough to search by text within the programs own data base and it automatically learns items entered repeatedly or set as favorites but to be perfect for me, they need to fix that. Still, I would recommend this to any one looking for a food and exercise tracking program wholeheartedly.
1595, this case is a perfect fit. It snaps right into place and doesn't move one bit. You have clear touch to all your buttons, at least  I do. It does come with a belt clip which is optional to put on. You have one screw to hook it up onto the case. this is a nice option if you just want a hard case and not the clip. I haven't tried to take off the case from the phone. So I don't know if it will come off nicely or breaking in the process, I hope not to find out. Either way, for the price of this case, it's hard not to praise it.
1596, As a college kid I am constantly on the go and my iPhone's battery takes a beating. For christmas I received this portable battery and it has already saved me on numerous occasions. It is great how small it is as I can put it in my pocket or can quickly charge my phone up in one of my backpack pockets. It is really quick and am amazed at how I can charge my phone up twice on it. It does take a long to charge the battery pack but what I recommend is to charge it overnight along side your phone. I charge it on a dual usb hub with my iPhone so when I leave in the morning I can grab both without forgetting one or the other. It is a great product that I highly recommend and many people have been impressed with its abilities. Looking forward to more from this company!
1597, We purchased this tub in transparent blue. At first sight it seems HUGE. It's because the tub has two "sides". One for infants who need to lay reclined, and the other is for older babies/toddlers who can sit up with minimal or no support. Other reviews state that the drain is slow, but I wouldn't know....I use the tub inside our regular bath tub and dump it when we're finished. Our tub is stored hung on a nail on the bathroom door or turned over in the big tub. It's very ergonomic for baby and allows whoever is bathing baby to use both hands for washing. Have been using this tub for about four months and have NO complaints. Sturdy, easy to clean, easy to store, and my baby loves it! It also matches our blue themed bathroom quite nicely. Also the shipping time was great!
1598, With all of the raves from you folks who own this on VHS, I checked under DVDs for Stevie Ray Vaughan on Amazon and found that it is coming out on DVD as of September 4, 2007.  Thus, I preordered it.  I am obsessed (my wife's words with which I pretty much agree) with SRV.  I own all of his DVDs and his commercially available CDs, along with some bootleg CDs.  This will complete my DVD collection on SRV....for now, anyway. Here is how to find this one on Amazon:Pride and Joy
1599, This was one masterpiece recording by JG to this day.  The songs on here just touch you in ways imaginable.  I got me going with some of my old flames from back in the day.  "Provocative and Let's Get The Mood Right" were two nice projects as well, but this one was tops.  Unfortunately, JG was overshadowed by a few other artist in the 90's.  I think we all know who they are.  But JG was and still is one of the great voices of the last 20 years.
1600, Well I was a little skeptical to order this necklace at first cause of some of the reviews saying they got theirs kinked and what not. But I took a risk and ordered it anyways......when I got the item it came in a secure box and it arrived super fast. Like really fast. I opened the box and took it out of the zip loc baggy and jewelry baggy it came in and it was super shiny and nice. My only regret was getting it in 20 inches, it's a little small but that was my mistake. I should've gone with a 22&#34; or a 24&#34;. I'll probably order again and hand this one to my lady. It is diamond cut cause it sparkles like crazy when the sun hits so I don't know what people are talking about theirs being dull. It's a nice little peice to hold a small pendant and at a good price so I don't know what people are complaining about.....
1601, "The Phantom Tollbooth" is the magnum opus of all involved--that's saying a lot--considering it is co-directed by animator Chuck Jones and stars the very talented Butch Patrick (who was featured in "Pressure Point" and "A Child is Waiting"; as well as a regular on "The Munsters")."Tollbooth" is not only a film for the whole family, but is actually GOOD for the entire family.  Some features will teach children that academics are important, this piece of entertainment goes beyond that and teaches that being a human being is important.Despite what some critics have written--the songs are awesome and the storyline is very entertaining!
1602, I recently purchased Legend of a Band along with the longer and more expensive Classic Artists 3-DVD set.  I must say while LOAB doesn't show as much footage as CA, it does seem to tell the story much clearer and without a lot of the superfulous interviews of people that most of us have never heard of anyway.  I am a huge John Lodge fan and the segment of him at the  site of The Isle of Wight Festival was fantastic and that alone was well worth the price of the DVD! I highly recommend this to any MB fan.
1603, This album is still just as incredible and compelling to meas it was when I first heard it as a 9-yr old kid in 1973!Those were the days when artistic giants still walked the earth!Just put it on...you don't have to skip over any tracks!Now how many albums can you say that about today?"Too High", "Visions", "Living For The City", "Golden Lady","Higher Ground", "Jesus Children Of America", "All In Love Is Fair","Don't You Worry 'Bout A Thing" and "He's Misstra Know-It-All"...One complete thematic vision from start to finish!!'Nuff Said!Incidentally, 1976's "Songs In The Of Life" is number 2and 1972's "Talking Book" is number 3!Only but a handful of artists of the last 30 yrscan claim even one masterwork in their career!Stevie has three! He was definitely tuned in to thecreative force of the universe during his hey-day!His music is just timeless and seamless and will alwaysinvoke love, stimulate positive thought & emotion!
1604, I had this on VHS back in the early 90's.  Remarkable for me to get to see this as I was not even born until about a year after the Beatles split up.  Beatlemania was non-existent in my youth.  This doc really brings it home as to why they have endured.  the screaming fans who may have swooned to their looks or accents were also swooning to their musical talents, which were only beginning to blossom.  This is easily the bud of the flower that fully bloomed by the time Abbey Road was finished.  You get as one other reviewer called it "The Real Hard Day's Night."  Although it would be interesting to see what did wind up on the cutting room floor.  Excellent viewing to get a glimpse of what 1964 was like with the Fabs in the USA!
1605, As I've discussed in my previous review of the same title,Innervision reputation preceeds it.The newly remastered version(8 of the 9 tracks appears in remastered form on At the Close Of A Century box set)also  includes a better packaging job compared to its first pressing as well as  superior sound quality that makes this sounds like listening to it for the  first time all over again.Like the rest of his 70s masterpieces(Music Of My  Mind,Talking Book,Fullfillingness...)this remastering project give his  music the respect that it has always accorded with the sound quality it  deserves.
1606, I love this app and have used it for nearly a year, but ever since the last update it stalls, freezes, jerks to other screens, fails to open, and has just generally become such a nuisance that I've pretty much switched to using the desktop version. Reinstalling didn't help, just proved it wasn't' t a different app making my kindle so herky-jerky. Too bad, because the update was otherwise a real improvement, making the interface more intuitive and fixing some of the more frustrating aspects of using the food database. I hope they work out the bugs soon. My husband has no problems with it on his iPod.
1607, Nice cover and much better then the one that came with my Hybrid RV. Allows you to get to the valves from the top which is really nice if you have a Hybrid where the front bed is above the LP tanks so if you need to get to your tanks you won't have to put the pop-out beds back in just to lift the cover off the LP tanks. The top opening lid isn't going anywhere like someone posted here that they lost it on the road. If you close it like you should it locks in place and is very secure... no way could it come off and get lost. I Ordered Polar white and thats what I received and matches the old one.
1608, so I started to use this today I thought it would be a easy way to track what I eat how ever it did the job I wanted but it adds calories back when you log excersice so really kinds defeats the purpose you don't want to add back calories just from working out you want to eat only the aloud for the day and work that off so that part I don't like and I tried adding the calories back under shacks but it just ended up saying I ate more than I did but I was under so a little confused on that part
1609, Update 03-04-2014Everyone should have one of these. It's come in handy so many times, especially for people whom travel a lot for business or pleasure. I love that it is a USB charger as it can be used for any such device that supports such. Would I like it to charge longer? Who wouldn't? One full cell phone charge is more than tolerable for the size/price.Original review:If you're looking for the simplest of conveniences, look no further. This product does exactly what you need it to do which is charge your phone one full charge where you may not be able otherwise.Elegant design, simple operation. Fits comfortably in your pocket or purse. Built in LED flashlight and Laser Pointer are a plus. Great peace of mind product!FYI, I get 1/2 a charge on my iPad from this device and a full charge on my ipod.
1610, I have only been playing the game for a week. I only learned the rules of how to play and started with another free Sudoku game three weeks ago. I think there needs to be a how to on how to play for those new to the game...which would be very helpful to new players. The other game I play allows the display of small numbers possible in each square to help you keep up with what can be played. I like that and think it should be a help option. On the other game you have to remove numbers you use for the squares left to see what number you can play if it could delete used numbers in unsolved squares that would be very cool. I stile this one very much and play everyday a few game sessions.
1611, Pros:-Very small compaired to other battery packs I had in past with similar milliamps.- Two extra features that I use very often. Laser and LED light-Same cable for my android phone is used to charge the iTorchCons:- None at allThe iTorch is a great every day accessory for anyone with a cellphone or a tablet who finds themselves always running low on battery power when a wall charger is not accessible.Where I work I can not plug in my smart phone and find it running low on battery life by 3pm. The iTorch is small enough to fit in my pocket with my phone.It is a must have if you own any electronic device. It makes a great holiday gift for anyone male or female.
1612, Bought two of these for our travel trailer that has two steps.Husband says it was an easy quick install.It looks good on the steps (new trailer definitely want it to look good)Stays in place and weathers well.This trailer has no carpeting so dirt shows up quickly.  this definitely helps reduce the amount of dirt being tracked into the trailer.  While these are important I also have an awing rug on the ground outside the trailer and a small rug inside the door.  (have grandchild that travels with us so everything that can help reduce the dirt is huge)
1613, I have been using MFP for almost 2 years now and have yet to be disappointed! The only time it doesn't know a food is if it's the obscure brand that my local grocery store sells! It has helped me lose 30 lbs in 3 months and I am still steadily losing! I will recommend pairing it with Drs advice, bc he put me on 1500 calories a day, whereas the app tells me I can have 1750, but nonetheless, This app has literally saved my life! I recommend it to everyone I know and have even managed to get 5 or 6 people on it with me so I have a great support system :D I hope this helps someone change their life like it has done for me!
1614, Not that all synths are wimpy of course. In fact, all musicians do is move their fingers and limbs a little bit so it's not like that's so tough. But the sound here is FN raw. If your cranium needs a good scraping, this one delivers. Jarring and abrasive with full-throttle hard-core drum thwaking most of the time (synthetic but not whimpy, get it?). The songs sound quite a bit alike, but that's the point. This album is pretty relentless. Perfect for that aggresive mood, but use caution while driving. Sectionally intercoursed  (totally %#@-ed up) . . . nasty and rude, too.Note: in case you don't know - a "Columbian Necktie" is when someone slits your throat and pulls your tongue through, a favorite tactic of certain South American mafia sickos.
1615, I love this product!!!  It is one of the few things that I knew I wanted with my second child that I didn't have with the first, and I have not been disappointed.  I use mine on my changing table and it keeps everything so handy in one place.  It is always neat and together, and I never have to look around for what I need.  My son is still in size 1 diapers so I do find that when I pull a diaper out another one might fall out.  This is a minor inconvenience for the organization that it provides.  The last thing you want in the middle of a diaper change is to be disorganized!
1616, I must completely disagree with any disgruntled reviewers of this wonderful dvd performance of "La Traviata" starring the beautiful & talented Anna Moffo. The print and sound quality are excellent. So what if they are lip-synching! Many of us including myself were not even born yet when Moffo was in  her prime and were unable to see her live performances. This is a terrific memento of the greatest American born soprano in her heyday. The acting and cast are all outstanding. 5 stars for Ms. Moffo's portrayal of Violetta. Pick it up and see for yourself.Brava La Moffo!
1617, I was getting an evap code on my Disco II. Gas caps have a pressure release that can wear out over time. Once I replaced my gas cap with this new one, the code went away. It is a nice, cheap, and easy fix. I've only had it about three months though, so I cannot comment too directly on the long term quality of the product, but I imagine for $6 it will last plenty long until I need a new one. Even if it only lasted a year I would be satisfied, but I'm sure it will last much longer.
1618, If you like police shows, you may enjoy this one.  If you are averse to violence, skip it.  The show follows the exploits of a &#34;special forces&#34; group of five, four men and one woman, (with the later addition of a woman FBI agent,) who work mostly undercover.  The group saves a lot of court time and prison expenses by, as often as not, fatally shooting the miscreants.  The FBI agent is played by the always gorgeous Tricia Helfer and the leader of the crew  by an always dependable Dylan McDermot.  The female member of the group, with the silicone-enhanced mouth, played by Nicki Aycox.
1619, My husband and I love this tub. So roomy and it's very clean/sleek looking! Our son was very cramped in his smaller tub at just 4 months of age! His toes would reach the end of the tub! My son is in the 90 percentile for his height & 60 percentile in weight.Now the reason why I gave it 4 stars: It is not ideal for newborns because it doesn't come with a hammock. From 0-4 months, the smaller tub was great for our son. It also allowed us to bathe our son standing up because the smaller tub fits on top of the kitchen sink. This tub does not. If you have a smaller baby, I don't recommend this for your newborn! In my opinion this is more ideal for babies who are 14lbs and up!
1620, Ok, this is how I do it.. First, you will find &quot;on my review list&quot;, nothing but the best for Kindle Fire Users, aka &quot;Must Haves&quot;.. I use this news app to put &quot;URLs in&quot; of every news place you would ever want or need!!!.. This way, if your nice news app is down, or you simply want more news from that area, you have it.. I also add my own local news in this one, since they have no app yet.. Simply copy the url of the news page you want, bring it back to this and give it a name, bingi!!.. Enjoy all!...
1621, Item: Double Extend MascaraBrand: L'Oreal9 times out of 10 L'Oreal makes a smash hit product I would use over and over again, this is an item in the 1 out of 10. It didn't work very well, it didn't feel good, and it was pricey for not working so well.Positives-Easy to Open (Unless Crushed Over)Negatives-Crushes If Not Shut Super Tight and Cleaned Closer-Heavy and You Can Feel It-Clumps-Makes Lashes Stick in Big Clumps You Can't Get Apart-Hard to Wash Off, Even With Eye Makeup Remover-The White Doesn't Always Cover With the Black-To Thick a Brush-Gets Old and Crusty To Quickly
1622, I really like Avent's versatility; the nipples, spouts, cups, bottles and handles can all be used interchangeably.I don't like the way they classify their nipples.  Each nipple has 3 classifications.  I wish they would only use one classification system because it can be quite confusing if you go to buy different nipples.1.) flow2.) baby's age3.) a numberAlso, the title of the item doesn't say what age or number of nipple this is, and there currently isn't a description.FYI:They are number 3 for 3+ months.
1623, The first time I saw this, I was like what?  Udder cream?  Really?But, all kidding aside, this is a very good lotion and I have bought it and used it for years and also given it as a gift.  Its actually pretty funny to give to someone who has never heard of it and then watch their double-take when they see the name.I prefer this size so that I can take it with me on trips and keep some in my purse.It doesn't go on as thick as some lotions, but works into your skin really well and keeps it moisturized.  Really great for the winter or if you work with paper or someplace where you have to wash your hands a lot.
1624, Largely a project of Paul McCartney's, (who was advised to junk it but refused) this hour long travelogue was savaged upon it's release to television.  Occasionally dull and more often than not disjointed, the musical sequences save the day, and you won't see a performance of &quot;I Am The Walrus&quot; anywhere else.  Film seems to hold up much better today in the age of music videos and as a landmark of 1960's psychadelia.  Beatle fans and 1960's buffs are sure to enjoy this more than a casual viewer.
1625, This bath tub is everything we wanted in a tub for our baby. It has ones side where she can lie down and the other side where she can sit up. We started using this when she was 5 months; she could not yet sit by herself. She is now 8 months and sits very well on her own. She'll use the sitting up side for part of her bath, but still very much enjoys lying down on the other side. I was hesitant when I bought it, but now that we've had it for a few months, I would definitely buy it again.
1626, Don't have much to add, except that when the DVD of this is eventually released, I hope they add back in the extra songs -- I remember seeing this on Showtime a few times the fall after it was filmed and it was much longer than this.Those of us who were in high school (I was in 9th grade when this aired originally) remember how great it was to discover U2 because they sounded like nothing else on the airwaves at the time.  Haven't listened to them seriously since "Zooropa" but this video and the accompanying LP (yes, I still have this on vinyl!) are always a great trip down memory lane.  And the music still stands up -- all these years later.
1627, I don't use the drain feature, so that doesn't bother me (other people have said it's hard to drain.) I love that it's roomy and has a couple different options for seating. I lay my kiddo down to bathe him but allow him to sit up to play. Actually, he can switch himself between the different seating options now (he's 8 months), which worries me a little, that he's that mobile in the tub, but hey, I'm right there watching, so I guess it doesn't matter much, and it entertains him to move around and chase toys around the tub.
1628, The jeans are fine but if you are expecting to get the color it shows you (you don't)they are a very dark blue almost purple tige to them like the old 80's ruff skinsso when I bought them and got a color I didn't really think was right I double checkedmy order, my husband doesn't mind so much they are for work, but he does not like the color,going to try and upload a pic (I will put indigo blue) on the pic so you can see for yourself...So they need to update that, I would not have bought them in this color...
1629, I ordered a handful of different creams to experiment with, and this is the one that I've found least compelling. I've actually gotten up from bed to wash it off as it was burning me. Maybe--- maybe the burning/stinging is somehow a good thing, but it made me nervous (and, of course, hurt a bit!). I've read that retinol is not suggested for people under 40 or maybe 45 and maybe it's just a mismatch between me and the product. Hence, why I was experimenting!
1630, The K&N HP oil filters are the model of K&N with the 1&#34; nut on the end so that you don't need an oil filter wrench. If you're a DIY person you will appreciate being able to tighten/loosen this in a small space  where it is very hard to get a standard oil filter wrench of any kind. All you need is a 1&#34; wrench. This particular size fits my Miata and the filter is squeezed into a tiny engine cavity where access is very limited. This filter is a breeze to install or remove from above the car. The K&N brand is made by the same company that makes Mobil1 oil filters and that is as good as it gets. I highly recommend this filter for Miata owners and I recommend K&N HP (with the nut) and PS (without the nut) for all vehicles. The quality is excellent and Amazon has the best prices.
1631, I have no idea why I chose to read this book.  I don't typically read science fiction of any type.  However, I began reading, and to my dismay, I couldn't put it down.  Certainly the book is laced with science jargon and science facts, and I had to reread a passage or two, in order to attempt an understanding of the science, but...  This book features a strong cast of characters, good guys and bad.  I think Robinson does an outstanding job of introducing us to his characters, and we get a real sense of who each person is and what motivates them.  It's a real study in both science and sociology, and I just LOVED it!
1632, The pants arrived quickly and without any rips, stains or damages. The pants were a little bit too big when I took them out of the package but they fit perfectly after I washed them once. I've only worn them as work pants 9-10 times but so far they are very durable, not too warm, and the pocket on the lower right thigh is very handy to hold a knife, pen, box cutter, flashlight, or many other things. I would absolutely order another pair of these if I needed to.
1633, I have loved the Carpenters music ever since I was about 7 years old ( which used to get me some strange looks in the playground) and I am now 19 and while I listen less as my tastes have expanded I still think of Karen as one of the greatest vocalists of all time and Richard one of the best arrangers.It is inspiring that to people of all ages that 2 normal kids from Downey can achieve the success and reach the heights that they did.However some videos can be harrowing and even heartbreaking to watch as Karen and Richard's personal demons take hold.Richard was able to overcome his, but unfortunately fame for Karen came less easily and the price too high.She is gone physically her spirit and soul live on through her brother and her voice.Karen's star may have only shone briefly, but few have shone brighter and with more beauty.
1634, I own &quot;Characters&quot; on vinyl. There are two songs on Side 1 that i feel are really great and fun to dance to. I'm talkin about &quot;Dark N Lovely&quot; and &quot;In Your Corner&quot;. Whenever i'm in a really bad mood or if i have one of those days where it feels like it can't get any worse, i just play those 2 songs back to back and then...instant good mood. I would suggest buying this cd just for those 2 songs alone. I'm gonna go listen to the rest of the album now...
1635, When I was younger, this was a a great toy that you had, however, the more you used it/shaked it, the more bubbles that got into the blue water, sometimes making the answer hard to read.  But apps don't have bubbles and this fascinates my niece who has never even heard of a magic 8 ball....she plays it often.  Also, if I have my kindle at work, this is a fun app and a great tension breaker when we are having brainstorming meetings.
1636, I originally used another app that wasn't as nice as this one; I'm glad I stumbled upon this.  This app is easy to use and great to keep track of what you're consuming on a daily basis.  I recommend it all the time.  So much better than an actual food journal, you can look up most foods or the individual parts of what you're eating to calculate the calories.  Also tracks exercise and water.  It syncs well on my phone and kindle fire.
1637, I was told would enjoy this book by Clancy and wow I did.....Is a book that grabs you and the start and doesn't let go until the very last page.. I really got lost in this book, all the way thru is action and just when you want slow down more action jumps up for you..  Some books can be a little slow either at first, middle or toward the last, but not &#34;Without Remorse&#34; if you like action you will love this book as Clancy delivers all the way.....
1638, I started purchasing these types of oil filters since I had problems removing the cheaper oil filters. I do my own oil changes and hand tighten them. For some reason the oil filters would get stuck. Then I tried using the oil wrenches to get them off and it would bend the filter making the filter wrench useless. I would have to drive a screwdriver through it to get them turned and off. I grew tired of this so I purchased a k&n with the welded nut. With these I have no problems. With the nut I use my wrench and twist that sucker off. Makes everything much easier and no more messy oil trying to get a filter off. As far as performance who knows. I have 99 cherokee with 160,000 miles and still running strong.
1639, For some inexplicable reason, this incredible performance is not available on DVD! (Mr. Knopfler has since corrected this situation). Because this is Dire Straights in their PRIME, folks, on a fantastic night in London in front of diehard fans who know every molecule of the music. And for all the guitarists out there (okay, all you air guitarists too)what a banquet of virtuoso playing this is. Not to be forgotten, drummer Terry Williams turns in a performance of Keith Moon-like magnitude, as well. And all those great songs, each presented as compelling drama. This is one of those all time high water marks for quality rock and roll.
1640, it's a bit more expensive that the OEM cabin filter, but the charcoal activated one seems to do a better job at keeping those exhaust fumes from entering the cabin. You know that situation- you have you AC or heat on fresh air, you're stuck in traffic, and soon enough, you smell the car exhaust from around you.  Since putting this filter in though, i have not noticed any smell of fumes, so while it's new at least, it does a great job of keeping your cabin air nice and clean.
1641, After I read all the reviews here on Amazon, I bought this bathtub right before the baby was born.  I had received 3 different baby tubs as gifts and returned them all and I'm glad I did. The baby is now 6 weeks and I can say that it is a well designed tub.Pros: Works great for newborn and the baby can continue to grow into it. The baby feels safe in the built in cradle for smaller babies.Cons: Only downside is it is super big.  I have to use it in our kitchen or the master bathroom where we have a large enough counter top.  Make sure you have enough counter space to place the tub on.  I would not put this in a regular size tub, can't imagine bending over like that is good for anyone's back or knees.Overall:  I highly recommend this tub.  Baby is happy and safe.
1642, This item was recommended as a piggyback purchase when I purchased a Plantronics Voyager Pro+ bluetooth headset.  It was advertised as a desktop charging stand for the headset.  Apparently, it's a base for the Voyager 510 charger (the old, first Voyager that Plantronics introduced, which I owned light-years ago in technology time).  The Pro+ fits awkwardly in it (tight fit) and the base does not come with a charger (although the picture shows a cord attached to it).  It's just a desktop weight and the Voyager Pro+'s charger does not fit.  When you jam it in there, the base does not sit flat and rolls around on the desk.  It does not stand vertically.  In sum, it's a rather expensive paperweight that advertises Plantronics.  Thanks for nothing and i hope it helps some of you save your money.
1643, Total conjecture about what might have happened with a lost Roman Legion.  Still, more or less true to the times, and the interactions between soldiers in a war in a far away country when part of a Global Empire.  Down at the personal level though effected by the big issues.Generally good performances by all important characters.  A few illogical scenes, but not to many, and none puncture the suspension of belief any good movie requires.Give it a shot if you are interested, you likely won't be much disappointed.
1644, While the app description says it doesn't support all tablets, I tried it anyway. It seemed fully functional on the Xoom except for one thing. The picture taking interface stays in portrait mode when taking picture regardless of device orientation. Having checked the settings for something to fix that, I found that the settings screen can display in landscape but no such option. The app easily switches between the front and back camera as well but both are placed on the device expecting landscape usage. Even having the option to rotate the picture while staying portrait mode might be preferable. While taking pictures is not ideal on this device, it does work and it's more ideal than using phone my which has no front facing camera. The developer shouldn't have too much difficulty fixing this minor issue however they decide to and if they want to.  I'm hopeful for update soon.
1645, Where have these been in the past? These wipers really need great reviews because they belong in an exclusive class far and above all others. They look deceivingly fragile and simple but the truth is they are designed for one task where they excel. They should be called Gliders not Wipers for they remove snow, debris and water without a sound and amazingly remain in contact with the glass throughout their paths.They have remained in good condition for me far longer than others. I do like the fact their ultra low profile makes no wind noise at speeds plus they look very sleek.In short they are worth the extra cost many times over. Give these a try, you will never go back!
1646, I've played this on my android phone and really liked it, so when i got my kindle fire hd I immediately purchased it here. But it's missing the auto fill and auto pencil feature, for some reason, that's in the Play store version. Why??? I don't know. But I don't like not having it.I've since uninstalled this version and side-loaded the other company's version which works flawlessly on  the Fire with all the features. This is another failure for the Amazon app store.
1647, This is a GREAT tool to get a better understanding of how many calories you are consuming so that you can adjust for a healthier lifestyle!  I was astounded by how many calories were consumed in one meal at some of the chain restaurants we dine at!The food database is quite large-plus it is easy to add a new food when you know the nutrition info and can't find it online.  The quick-add calorie function works well too if you don't want to save a food entry.  It also shows which foods you use often (or last) for quicker entry.  Not only does it have the nutrition counter-it also tallies your exercise.  Great app for dieting or just becoming healthier!
1648, I have been using myfitnesspal for several years now...it helps me keep track of what I've been eating so I can look back as a resource...helps keep me on track for good choices & motivates me to work out when I see that maybe I have taken in a few too many calories for the day...so if I work out then I can keep things going smoothly with a workout...this app/website has helped me for years...I have recommended it to many and will continue to do so...LOVE IT! Thank you myfitnesspal!
1649, This watch is perfect for me.When I lost my 8 year old watch on the train, there were features that I had to have on my new one and this watch has them all.- The indiglo light is a must for me as I'm often in a dark room and need to know what time it is.  The light is just right without causing a disturbance for others.- Once I started looking for a watch, the date feature became very attractive to me.  I use it all the time now and don't have to look at the calendar on my cell phone as often.- The gold and silver look of the watch set things up for me so that I can wear any earrings, etc. and feel it all comes together.- Water proof and comfortable to wear.  It's great!
1650, Installed easily and is working fine so far. The kit came with a rubber O ring type gasket which my old cap did not have. Takes a bit of doing to get this gasket positioned to stay in place for an air tight fit but I managed it. The cap could definitely be installed without it but thought I'd give it a try since it was included. I could swear I'm hearing less noise out of my engine with the gasket installed. In any case, all is well that fits well. :-)Installed on a '99 Honda Civic LX, 4 door sedan.
1651, My fiance insisted I buy this for his niece as he can not stand the sight of her chewing on her fingers all the time.  She will be going to school soon and we hoped this would stop a bad and nasty habit.  I applied the product several times and she said it did indeed taste horrible.  However, after a few times, she began to bite her nails anyway.  She said it tasted bad but, would often just keep doing it with a disgusted look on her face.  I do believe this product would work for any child that isn't so insanely stubborn.  I think she just needs an attitude adjustment but, she isn't my child lol.
1652, This shoe has so much to offer, I can't recommend it enough. The leather is hand tooled (says so in the box), and beautifully detailed with a subtle wing tip look. I bought the black leather, and it has little bronze or gold accents as shown in the photo. The size I purchased was a 9.5 Wide and it fit my feet so perfectly I didn't have to break them in. They felt good all day, every day I have worn them for 8 hrs or more at the office, and walking to and from transit. They are also lined in a light colored leather, which I also find appealing because fabric and synthetic liners can make your feet stink.  I have dancer's bunions, and these did not bother them one bit with the wide width. They fit very true to size for me with the wide selection. I am going to order them in Navy and Brown, they are so perfect.
1653, It is a very fun game.  The reason I rated it only 4 stars is because every time you loose, an add for dragonworld or something like that pops up and it doesn't go away right when you tap it so about half the time you play its just adds.  But the game is pretty fun so if you don't mind the add part then get it. PS To all those people out there who said it crashes on their kindle fire you probably have somethings wrong with it because it works picture perfect on mine.
1654, Hi Folks,this just arrived and while  Amazon.com claims its run  time is  60 minutes its actually 1:30 for the concert  another bit for a couple of  classic TV appearances and another hour for a very cool documentary which is archival quality not something produced recent...so I feel pretty darned happy for my 12 dollar investment indeed!!Whether I would upgrade to blu-ray is debatable....the picture is  not poor but its  of its age and not  something perhaps benefited  by that format...Jump  on this one folks!!!
1655, When I got a second bike I needed a way to keep the batter maintained during the winter. I wasn't comfortable using my Battery Tender Plus on multiple batteries as it's not a very wise practice. So I went with the Jr  as it's considerably cheaper.I think the only difference in the two is the amperage. The Plus will charge slightly faster.Also the Plus is a box that sits on the floor while the Junior hangs out on the outlet itself.I Purchased this January of 2013 and it still works strong. I also don't even bother unplugging it from the outlet when I'm not using it. So it is very reliable.
1656, As someone who uses his cell phone constantly, I'm always looking for portable power. I love my 4.5" screen on my phone, but it does drain the battery rather quickly. If I'm out and about, there's no way I'm getting through a full day on a single charge. The iTorch is just the thing I need to keep me connected. The small sleek size is perfect for my pocket allowing me to bring it anywhere I go. It's by far the smallest portable batteries I have and I love it. Plus the built-in flashlight is a nice extra feature. It also has a laser pointer but since I don't have cats I probably won't use it.
1657, PROS:This tub is PERFECT for my 6 month old. It's nice and big, the water covers her whole body and she has room to splash and play with good support. She still uses the lying down position. We don't usually use the drain plug, it's light enough to just dump the water out.CON:For 0-3 months this tub had issues because it does not have the newborn sling.  (It looks like there are holes for one but there's nothing to buy from Primo).Our solution was to place a folded towel beneath her in the bath which did work great and provided her comfort and support while bathing.  You just have a soggy towel to wash after every bath which is taxing.
1658, I ordered some old fashioned suspenders, the kind construction workers use to hold up heavy tool belts.  2 inches wide and made with heavy duty metal hardware.  I also ordered a small set of make-up brushes for my daughter.  I ordered them with free shipping through prime.  What I did not expect when I ordered these on a week day evening was rhat they would be delivered in less than 24 hours...free of charge! (with my prime membership).  GREAT service from Amazon and ace hardware direct.
1659, This curling iron is perfect for creating big, soft waves on my shoulder length hair. You can adjust the heat settings and get it pretty hot if you have harder to curl hair. I really like how it smoothes out the frizzies as it curls, so my hair is wavy and smooth.  Because the barrel is so big, the curls aren't tight at all and I like that for a more casual look.  I'm really happy because it gives me nice hair without looking overly "fixed."
1660, Don't believe the high praise many give this book. The characters are all unappealing and impossible to connect too,  the events are frequently unrealistic,  and the book drags terribly at times.  It certainly isn't all  bad.  Sometimes it seems as if it's about to get positively interesting but  it always manages to get back off track.  The idea:  the first colonist on  Mars deal with idealogical conflicts about how to treat this new frontier  could have made a compelling book.  But in this case, it didn't.
1661, We got this for a one step down into a den. Well, this gate has a metal plate across the bottom which becaome the cause of many trips, baby included. Also, the handle mechanism actually fell open/aprt. the first time, dh just screwed it back together. It did it a total of 4 times before we just took it down. THe opening is VERY NARROW. I have many scratches and bruises on hip from that gate. DH too. If you are REALLY skinny with no dh, okay, maybe. Also, when walking through, when you turn to close and push down, sometimes the plastic didn't go under the red tab, totally defeating the purpose of the gate
1662, Season 1 of Leverage was pretty solid through and through, Season 2 began what I feel to be a hit-and miss trend, and Season 3 continues what Season 2 started, both good and bad.Now, I love the show - even the episodes that I feel are not very strong are still fun and overall entertaining.  The episodes that ARE strong may be the strongest of the series, but unfortunately are not as plentiful as in previous seasons.  Missing more than other seasons is the slick "flow" that reminded me, in prior episodes, of a 42 minute Ocean's movie each week.It's still well written, funny, high-tech and worth watching - it just feels like its slipped a bit from its previously high elevation.
1663, Like many have said, this little remembered Disney film is basically `Aladdin' with birds, but it's still a lot of fun and certainly worth a gander.  I loved Duck Tales as a kid and so this was one of those cartoons I watched over and over.  I really does pale in comparison to `Aladdin', a film that ups the ante with stunning songs and beautifully composed animation, but there is something special about `Treasure of the Lost Lamp', especially to us fans of the characters and the classic show.  The plot has some shaky spots, but they are forgivable thanks to the nostalgia.  Above all else, `Treasure of the Lost Lamp' is fun, and fun is sometimes enough.  It isn't really a classic by any means, but it serves a purpose.
1664, Watching the first episode I was not quite sold but in the second I fell for it completely. Set in London royal hospital starting in 1906 and based on recorded cases this BBC drama is compelling and watchable. Some of the societal problems we face now we're faced then by the doctors and nurses of the time. The primary setting is the casualty, E.R. Which then as now is often the gateway to a hospital. There were some major differences the, the E.R. Closed at night and patients lined up at the gates to be treated in the morning, not a second before the ordained time. And there were strict codes of conduct for doctors and nurses, rigid codes. One of the nurses is torn between her love of a handsome doctor and her true calling Another compelling character is the seemingly strict and cold matron, who really loves her nurses and patients.
1665, I have been wearing Hanes Silk reflections hosiery for over ten years now and do not purchase anything else.  I love the silky feel of Silk Reflections against my skin and they look and fit great.  They are very durable and last me for many wearings.  I caught my leg on the corner of a table one time and it cut my leg pretty bad but did not run my stockings.  These thigh highs are a great alternative to pantyhose and they stay up well, and the great thing is when you do get a run you only have to throw away the one stocking.
1666, The title of this package of Marvin's hits suggests something was left out; I can't imagine what it was.  I question whether his "Praise" or "Anger" are among his "very best", but I cannot find anything that was left out to fit those two in.  This is probably the definitive collection of Marvin's songs.  So many will evoke memories if you were around when they were first popular, from the light-hearted "Hitchhike" (he did the dance by that name when he sung it) to "heavier" tunes like "Mercy Mercy Me (the Ecology") and "Sexual Healing".  There are other hit-laden collections around but this one seems to be his most complete.  So many hits!  Buy this one.
1667, I had to return this phone after 2 days, It would reboot itself and or just lockup. I read about this before. It did have the latest firmware.  The price was $517 when I ordered, it dropped to $488 now. The nokia n95 8g  was 639 and that day I returned Nokia has it for $579 for like a day.  However, the drawback with the phone.  I use a treo and a blackberry. The lack of a keyboard is hard to deal with.  I really wanted to like the device it does allot.  The camera features are nice,  the 8g version seems to be the better way to go in terms of os since I think it has more operating memory.  Nokia is releasing the N96 soon, then the Nokia Tube, hence the price drops.  But it did work ok on att 3g, wifi worked,  the lock ups and freezing was not acceptable for a phone that cost $500.
1668, I don't know about you, but figuring out the plot of a show in the first 10 minutes or the direction of a season early gets very tiresome. Formula TV has become the norm, now in recent years we have been blessed with those exceptions like madmen, walking dead, house of cards, Breaking bad, et al. Rubicon somehow got buy me, and this show wouldn't be popular among most Americans because you have to invest some time in the first couple of episodes in character development, background, and general housekeeping. However, if you are willing to lend the director those couple of hours, in return you will receive some of the most Clancy like drama I have seen outside the pages of his books. Rubicon is one of those shows that I won't thickly forget. Even more exciting amazon has shown me more previously unknown shows I might like if I liked Rubicon. So enjoy.
1669, This is a decent video if you are a drummer. Lots and lots of drums throughout. Not much in the way of seeing Gilmore play guitar. You will see his face a lot but not much finger work. I was especially burned with &quot;One of these days&quot;. The version here is great, but you won't see anything but the drummer. If you are a musician and like to see your heros play this isn't the video to watch unless of course you play drums. The sound quality is very good. I WON'T be buying this one on DVD if it ever comes out.
1670, I've been using Borghese/Kirkland face serum for a few years and love it.  I decided to try the Regenerist products and purchased the eye serum, face serum and daily moisturizer.  I read all of the positive reviews about the face serum but wasn't expecting it to be any better than the Borghese/Kirkland.  I'm pleasantly surprised.  It has a similar gel-like consistency but seems to absorb more quickly.  For that reason, it feels lighter on my skin.  I guess I'm a convert.
1671, I only now just started watching Pretty Little Liars.While they are currently on something like season 4 I believe, I had trouble getting halfway through season one. What a ridiculous show. I started watching when nothing else was on. Even that isn't reason enough to continue. My complaints with the ridiculousness and inconsistency in this show are to many to list. The stupid decisions these girls make border on insulting to the intelligence of the audience. No matter what the target viewer is. The romanticized relationship between an English teacher (whom would be at the very least 24) and his 16 year old student is just irresponsible.  I can't image any parents thinking this show is ok viewing for their young teens or any adult finding this entertaining.
1672, You know, I was planning of walking to my local library later today to donate some old videotapes, including this one, for their collection, because I simply assumed that this would be available on DVD by now. BUT NOW I find out that is not the case! Why not, pray tell??? This is one of the greatest concert films ever made, second perhaps only to Talking Heads' &quot;Stop Making Sense.&quot; The setting, Red Rocks ampitheater near Denver, is a spectacular geological setting, with wind, fog, gas torches producing gigantic gouts of flame high above the audience, and mountain air chilly enough to show clouds of vapor pouring off Bono's skin. As for U2's performance, well, this was at a time (1983) when they were just moving beyond cult status and into rock superstardom, yet were still retaining enough of their keening punk purity to drive an audience into rapture. And what a lucky audience this is! PLEASE get this onto DVD as soon as possible!
1673, This is a fictional news "report - bulletin" about an imaginary nuclear confrontation between terrorists and the police. It is presented as if it were "REALLY" happening...And...it is so good...that if you didn't know you were watching a videotape..you would SWEAR it was "real".ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT!Right now, it's only on VHS but get it and burn it on to a DVD.Hopefully they come out with a DVD edition of this. It is one of my ALL-TIME FAVORITE VIDEOS EVER!I give it 5 stars ONLY because I can't give it more. It deserves it.
1674, I was deep in the upper Mojave Desert.  I've been to remote places like this and have not had any reception.  When I pressed this into service I had 4 full bars of service in the middle of nowhere.  I would however would advise that anyone considering the purchase of this kit, instead purchase the one with the cell phone antenna cradle instead of the bar antenna.  It's the black item on the right.  It is necessary to have that antenna as close to the phone as possible to achieve the highest performance.  So the universal cell phone cradle antenna serves that purpose much better.  I also have used this amplifier in town, and it shines when I get to areas where I've had weak signals in the past.  This booster kit works wonders.  It's highly recommended.
1675, Unenlightened drivel, acting high brow.  Full of foul language throughout, as far as I know (I couldn't finish the last fourth of the movie because I was so offended by the continued foul language and intolerance of religious persons).  I was hoping it would get better s it went along, showing the professor and his students were mistaken in their beliefs.  But alas they never learned the truth because they did not even want to believe there is truth.  What kept me going for as long as I did was seeing how these atheists act and think.  It did remind me of the bullying done at universities to Christians.
1676, I've been using My Fitness Pal for a week to track my calorie intake, and it's definitely become &#34;my pal&#34;!  It's helping me monitor what I eat and be accountable to myself.  It can be a little time consuming to get started, looking everything up, but it gets easier.  The option to save a meal is great for me, because I tend to repeat my breakfasts and lunches.  I haven't used the exercise logging yet...that's the next thing to learn!
1677, I enjoy playing sudoku to help relax me before I go to bed.  This game has several good points, there are several levels, and the numbers are easy to read.  I have run into problem with the squares of the number options.  Sometimes I hit one number, but the computer will put in the number next to it, such as a 9 instead of the 3. I have to rotate the screen to get the right number in.  The main reason that this is a problem, is that the game is then marked as having been won with computer assistance, and even though that is not important, it still bothers me, because I challenge myself in speed and finishing it without computer assistance.
1678, If your waist size is larger than 42&#34; I would think twice about ordering this &#34;one size fits all&#34; belt. My waist is 44&#34; and the belt will barely fit around me and buckle. I kept it because I am losing weight and it does seem to be of good quality. The buckle is easy to secure and doesn't loosen although I did have the buckle end tear out due to it's small size and not being properly secured. I re-did it and I'm watching to see if this will be a problem. I&#34;m wearing it with Dickies scrubs for work and it looks fine.I would recommenr this belt to anyone with a waist size of 42&#34; or less.
1679, We love this gate, we bought one to block of the top of the staircase, and we wanted a second one t block off the living area and the kitchen... unfortunately the coverage range of this product is very limited... even with the extensions.The gate overall is made out of solid material. The kickstand takes a bit of pressure to release, but it's good to have, because my son can't accidentally push it down and open the gate.The gate area is smaller than an average to walk through, but it's not too bad.Out of all the gates we have had we like the Hands Free gate the best. It would be the only gate we purchase only if it could a bigger area.
1680, This was the first Tom Clancy book I ever read, and picked it up on someone elses recommendation.  I was hooked on this book from the first paragraph.While it is a bit trashy and &quot;best seller-ish&quot; at times, I found it impossible to put down.  It was the best read I had had in a long time, and really enjoyed the unexpected turns and twists of the plot,(relentlessly surprising), and the richness of the scene descriptions and humble brillience of the indomitable main character.Just be sure you have enough time to read it all, because it is hard to put down! What fun!
1681, I STARTED PURCHASING THIS ROGAIN FOR MY HUBBY AFTER HIS GENETIC HAIR LOSS, AND THE HAIR OF HIS CROWN HAS GROWN BACK, AS SOON AS MY HUBBY FORGETS TO USE IT, HE FINDS  LOTS OF HAIRS ON THE PILLOW.I ALSO STARTED DEVELOPING HORMONAL HAIR LOSS AND STARTED USING THIS ROGAIN FOR MEN, WHICH IS STRONGER THAN THE ONE FOR WOMEN WHICH I USED TOO, THE HAIR AROUND MY HAIR LINE IS GROWING SLOWLY, THE ONLY PROBLEM I FIND IS THAT IT CAUSES DANDRUFF ON MY SCALP.i ALSO APPLY ROGAIN ON MY EYEBROWS AND THEY ARE GROWING!!! THE DOWNSIDE, HAIR ON MY FACE SO I HAVE TO BE CAREFUL WHEN I APPLY IT.
1682, This show from 1990 contains the largest, most complex stage setup ever used in a rock show, boggling the mind with all the moving parts and multimedia.  Amongst everything else, a gigantic wall is built during the show between the band and the audience, and knocked down at the end.A few of the guest performances fall flat, but The Wall was always as much about the creative, theatrical stage show as it was the music.  This is the only video release that lets you see Roger's vision of how the show was to play out live.  Since the original performances of The Wall in 1980-81 (with Pink Floyd) were filmed poorly, this may be the only video release of The Wall live ever.
1683, I paid extra for Carhartt pants for their &#8220;legendary&#8221;wear properties and made-in-USA origin, and their pants wore out prematurely, and production was moved to China.So I tried the more blue-collar Dickies. They look better, they fit better, they have a much better pocket design, and so far they seem to be wearing better. We'll see over the long term but so far I'm happy with them. They're made in Mexico, an improvement, I guess, over China. Not much seems to be made here other than cars, kitchen/laundry appliances, and Mac Pros...
1684, Works pretty slick and I like the compact size. I could only give it a 4 star rating because I bought it for my lawn mower and ATV battery. It has 2 separate instructions for whether it is left in the vehicle or the battery is removed. I bought this item to keep a battery topped off that has been removed and taken inside from the freezing temps. If battery is removed it says to add a 24&#34;( I think was the length) lead to the negative terminal. Not sure why this needs to be done. I have never done that with a regular full size charger. You get 2 sets of quick disconnect leads, one with clamps and ones you bolt into you vehicle. I would have settled for one lead with a 24&#34; longer negative lead than the positive.
1685, I've installed both TweetCaster and Seesmic on my Kindle Fire and have been waffling back and forth between them ever since.  So far, I like TweetCaster better.  When there are photos, I can see a thumbnail of it in the stream.  When I choose it, I can see the photo within the app.  I can see replies to other people's tweets.  When I pick a link, I'll see it in the browser, but I can get back to TweetCaster with the back button.In contrast, Seesmic doesn't display the thumbnails.  If I choose to see a photo, it takes me to the Fire's browser and I can't get back to Seesmic with the back button.  I can't seem to view replies to other people's tweets, either.  Seesmic is just a little clunkier.
1686, I love this product, and here is why.I have had it for a good year or two now, and it is still going strong. I am a college student and definitely am on my electronic devices a lot, and carrying this around in my backpack has saved me many times. I can charge my phone and friends' phones from my backpack in the middle of class. I get about 2.5 charges on my iPhone 5 from the charger. I plug it in to charge when I go to sleep and it is fully charged by the time I wake up, using just a 1 Amp charger brick.
1687, I wear a size 34 waist and based on the manufacturer's recommendations I ordered a size medium. They fit a little on the tight side around the waist, but I don't expect to be gaining any weight (hopefully). The manufacture of the pants looks to be very nice and I have not doubt they will serve their purpose very well. Although I have no complains with these pants, the next size I purchase will be a large - I prefer them to be a little loose as appose to a little tight.
1688, I read the first 4 books, but have been listening to this audiobook. I love this series by George RR Martin, but the reader of the audiobooks leaves much to be desired. Especially annoying is the high nasal voice he gives to all the female characters, so that they all sound like illiterate crones. And why did he choose such an odd accent for Tyrion? In places the reader slurs the names of people and places, leaving the listener confused as to who or what is being referred to. Very disappointing.
1689, I have a light olive tone complexion but I didn't know which color to go for since the pictures don't really give you any ideas. Also according to the charts, being 5'5,125lbs I'm a b but really I'm a c as these run small. I bought the toast in size b and light toast in size c. The toast was too dark, better for those with a caramel or darker skin tone. The b was also kind of tight on the waist. The light toast was too light. the toast though is closer to my complexion and since this is for my Wonder Woman (Linda carter style) costume, it will work. The c fit quite comfortably too. I really like that these tights have no lines and I wish I would have thought to purchase dancer tights a long time ago. I would like to buy a pair of normal, non shimmery ones for every day wear but I'm not going to spend extra on finding my right shade. But overall am pleased with the product.
1690, I bought a Citizen Eco watch while on a cruise many years ago and the band recently broke to the point of no repair. I had been looking for a nice looking band and even ran to my local jewelry store, the bands I found were in the $30 range so when I saw this one for less then $5 with good reviews I figured I'd give it a try. I'm glad I did! This band is a perfect replacement for my Citizen watch. It's not even close to the original band but it looks good and it fits perfectly. It did come with 2 pins to attach it to your watch, in my case the pins were too long and I fortunately still had the original pins so I was able to recycle those with this new band.If you have a watch and need a 20mm band and want one that looks good, this is the one you want.
1691, This wheel stop is great for keeping the RV trailer from rocking back and forward when walking around inside.  This is a must-have for travel trailers.  I bought two of these; one for each set of tires.  As one reviewer said, you may need to tighten them up a bit after a few days.  Measure the diameter of your tires first and the space between your tires before ordering.  This device comes in two sizes.  Built very sturdy and they are light in weight.  Need I say more.
1692, I have been using Obagi foaming gel for years and is, by far, the best face cleanser on the market.  It does not dry out your face, but it removes every bit of make-up.  I have tried other brands, but when you follow with a toner, the cotton pad always ends up looking like I never washed my face first.  This product removes all traces of make-up and never dry out your skin.  As long as I use this product daily - I have less break-outs and no dry patches.
1693, Over at Bobistheoilguy, K&N is one of the top rated oil filters. Now granted they're not the best, but they're a good compromise and they're FAR better in flow rate and filtration than Fram or any of the other cheap junk. If you want the best of the best, You're going to have to go with Royal Purple or PureOne, or Puralator. Even motorcraft ranks high. However this filter filters well, and flows oil well. Its not state of the art, but it still certainly does its job very well. Much better than those below it.
1694, These bottles are super good quality. I recently switched to them and it's so nice to be able to leave my baby's water in the car and not have it get plastic in it from the bottle. My baby loves these bottles. I bought some nipples for older babies but didn't have to use them because she likes the ones that came with these bottles even though she's 20 months old. I just use them for water (I don't like sippy cups). I don't know why someone said these bottles leak because I've never had a problem. It's great that they are making glass bottles again these days- finally the world is wising up and getting healthier!
1695, Since the last episode of Stargate SGU aired, I haven't watched the SyFy Network at all. I've missed the Stargate series (all of them) and it's clear that the network has no interest in producing customer-quality and popular series that, yes, might be expensive, but that's part of successful programming. In short, the network's decisionmakers are idiots. They had some templates that worked and they blew it. The stuff they have now is junk.Stargate Atlantis was great. SGU was cheap...but it grew on you. I didn't really watch it until I bought the DVDs. And it's strange that Season 1 was released in Blu-Ray and the second and best was not. It's just like SGA. The network just one day decided to pull the plug despite the viewership, quality and the fact that it was making money.
1696, is two clanking, grinding guitars, a harelipped bass player and a drum machine named Roland. Its Big Black, kiddies, and this IS their finest moment. Three nerds blasting the most vicious, vitriolic post-everything music you're likely to come across. Whether you're looking for your next sonic challenge or just looking to discomfit people as they rifle thru your record collection, this is something you shouldnt pass up. They broke up as soon as they realized they were being recognized...how much more anti-commercial can you get, if thats what you like? Features a Kraftwerk cover, and a Cheap Trick cover...the rest of the songs are mostly about really bad human behavior. Too bad Amazon wont get offended when you ask for it by name.
1697, My wife had been on me for years to try these since I work outside. Since we only get snow/ ice maybe 10-20 days a year here I just did not bother. Well we got a real good dumping of snow (for us) that came with 20 deg weather for a couple weeks. I finally gave in and tried these. I don't know why I waited. I went from slipping all over trying to walk in the packed ice, to almost feeling like I was walking on bare dry ground. They are amazing. Easy to put on and off, and they just work great.
1698, Note that this review refers to the original, I have not seen director's cut.This movie offers a rare inside glimpse at Pink Floyd in full freakdom. It is particularly poignant because it includes clips of floyd recording dark side of the moon, which was to jettison them to permanent stardom. But here you can see them play older psychedelic masterpieces as well as interviews with the band. As always, the band is contrary to most of their peers with their heavy psychedelic approach (and, based on a few of the interviews -- usage!) and intelligent if eccentric rants. A MUST for fans.
1699, This product is worthwhile, because you are going to be changing diapers constantly, and you need to throw them away in some sort of sanitary and convenient manner. When baby starts eating solids, there is quite a different aroma coming from his diapers! This device is basically a garbage can, but it helps keep the nursery from getting stinky. The only thing is, because it holds so many diapers, it can make the nursery smell very "baby powder-y". So keep the room well ventilated. The Diaper Genie is easy to use, and the refills last a long time. If you happen to live in a building, with a garbage shoot on your floor, then you don't need this. Just put a day's worth of diapers in a plastic bag, and down the shoot.
1700, I like the avent nipples because they don't deform like the medela ones. I haven't tried many nipples since he seemed to do fine on these. These are the newborn flow ones and although they are the slowest, it's still not slow enough. I'm trying to breast feed and sometimes he just gets impatient with me (I have a low supply) and wants the bottle. Sometimes I oblige depending on how loud he is and how tired I am.But these are easy to clean and switch out too. I bought these to put into some "2" nipples I had since I got a set of these avent bottles.
1701, I took a chance in buying this via video on demand and enjoyed it. From the opening scene as the kidnappers prepare their place for the captive, there really aren't any dull moments and even though all of the actors are no-name, they did a good job with the script. There were several points where you could feel the tension and you weren't sure whether the girl or the kidnappers would come out on top. Like one reviewer said already, there are a few twists (though one you will probably see coming) that keep you guessing how the movie will end. It won't win any Oscars, but it was definitely entertaining.
1702, Not only is this shirt super comfy and cozy, they shipped super fast.  I can't thank you enough and I will order from you again! Kudos!!!  Oh, I washed it with bleach in hot water and put it in the dryer.  No problem.  I'm a 3x but I love big shirts to bum around town in.  My friends want them so I'll be ordering more, decorating them, girling them up, and giving them as Christmas gifts.  Thanks again!
1703, No frills, sheer elegance in design! Love this bathtub. I was looking for a simple plastic design so that the tub would be easy to clean/sanitize with no mold issues. The closest highly rated blue whale tubFisher-Price Precious Planet Whale of a Tub(like most others), while really cute, has a tendency to develop mold in hidden crevices. The PRIEuro has no crevices. I have been using this since LO was 2 weeks old. She is 4 months now and still loves it. It is quite big in size but we have ample counter space on the vanity so it works well for us. Looking forward to using this until LO is a toddler!
1704, iCarly is a cute show with some mild adolescent humor.There's not much that a worried parent would deem inappropriate. The main characters are Carly, Sam, Freddy, Spencer, and Gibby. The antagonists are Nevelle, Lubert, and a few others who play minor roles throughout the show. The premise of the show centers around iCarly interacting with her peers and merging the typical adolescent activities with the Internet. My pre-teens love the show and I can follow it and stomach most of the story lines. I've even laughed at a few scenes in each episode. Expect wholesome fun when you watch the show.
1705, The first season of this series is very pleasant has all the ingredients of the best British period dramas.  There is a liberal helping of humor, a wide selection of local characters portrayed by a strong cast and enough history to make it interesting.  Julia Sawalha, who played the feckless Lydia in the classic 1996 Pride and Prejudice with Colin Firth, is the lead actress in a very different role.  She is the independent and strong-minded postmistress to the small town of Candleford.  Life and death, family secrets and the friction between town and the less prosperous country village of Lark Rise combine to make a satisfying contrast.
1706, None of my kids use bottles anymore, but when they did I went through so many brands and types of bottles trying to find one that I liked. My final choice was to settle on these glass bottles. They last so much longer than the plastic bottles. All of the plastic bottles that I tried got to a point where no matter how well I washed them, how hot the water was, even going through the dishwasher didn't get the formula smell out of them. Glass bottles are so much easier to clean, and so much easier to run through the dishwasher. Plus, in the diswasher the plastic bottles were never completely dried in the drying cycle. Not a problem with glass bottles.
1707, These bottles have been perfect for us.  We started bottle-feeding out of necessity when our baby was only 6 weeks old, and these bottles have worked perfectly.  They're BPA free, which means we don't have to worry about heating them.  We haven't had any trouble with the nipples, and we're currently using the Stage 2 (3-6 months) size.We love these bottles and their classic design.  And the price is great (BPA-Free plastic bottles often cost $12 each).  If you are bottle-feeding, I would recommend getting at least 12-15 of them so you don't have to wash and sterilize bottles everyday.
1708, This is a great app. I downloaded it in January so that I can become more aware of the amount of calories I consume in the effort to lose weight. This app works perfectly. You have to keep in mind it is an estimation of your calories, but based on the extensive database of previous entries it is a lot more accurate than I expected. I love the bar code scanner capability. It make food entry much easier. I also like that I can copy meals from previous days to today. I also love how you can have fitness pals that get updates on your progress. It helps with motivation, especially if you are competative. This has been instrumental with helping me exceed my weight loss goals. I can't complain about a product that works this well and was free.
1709, If you have never tried Sudoku, or don't understand the game, or are simply frustrated by it, this is a great way to learn! Levels run from easy through extreme, and you can &#34;pencil&#34; in possible values for the empty boxes by rotating the small pencil icon at the bottom diagonally, as well as &#34;erase&#34; entries that no longer fit. Permanent entries are entered by rotating the oencil back ho horizontal. There is a helper available for hints, validations, and solutions as well.
1710, There are so many pros, so few cons to this gate.  It's tall, there's no way my 2-year-old can get over it.  Incredibly convenient swinging door.  If you follow the instructions on how to correctly tighten it on the door frame you won't have trouble.  I didn't do that the first time and I was getting frustrated.  The gate was smarter than me!My son, who is Mr. Motor Skills, cannot open it.Would make an excellent dog gate for small dogs.Sometimes the pedal can get sticky and you have to push on it a little harder, but that's really my only complaint.
1711, This is no &#34;MURDER ONE, Season 1&#34;, but it is quite good.  If I remember my Wikipedia info, the network cancelled it after only four episodes, which is more indicative of network stupidity than of the show's quality.  I thought this was one of Rob Morrow's best works.  Regardless of the outcome of each case, guilty or not, the final minutes reveal what the &#34;Whole Truth&#34; was.  Don't be discouraged when Morrow's character loses the first three cases, since he then goes on a winning streak.
1712, I read the detailed report on wrinkle creams done by Consumer Reports.  They tested out all the top wrinkle creams out there.  The result: None produced significant results, but Olay Regenerist was the best.  If you have fine lines and unevenness due to dry skin, then this will help, no doubt, BUT it will not undo your wrinkles.  It's a great moisturizer, but I am concerned about all the synthetic chemical ingredients in this product.  After using this product, I'm switching over to something safer, more natural.
1713, I bought this for my Mom.  She has a riding mower that sometimes sits for a long time without use.  I used the connectors that you screw onto the terminals and then you have a little plug that you then connect to the charging unit whenever you need.  No clamping onto the battery, just plug it in.  You can leave this on all the time and it will shut off when the battery is charged coming on only when needed.  Safe and easy.  Great for over-wintering a battery when you want to keep it charged.Update.  I bought one of these for my truck which is not driven very often.  I first made sure the battery was charged since it is a heavy duty truck battery.  Then I did the screw mount connectors and leave the charger on all of the time.  It keeps the battery charged by shutting on and off as needed.  No need to tend it.Can't say enough good about this product for battery maintenance.
1714, I have been keeping a food diary off and on for years, but its always been a struggle for to to stay with it. MyFitnessPal calorie and diet tacker, now make it VERY easy. I can add my foods on my kindle or computer....and the amount of foods on the list is constantly growing. Adding your own recipes is easy too,add the ingredients and it automatically calculates the nutritional info for you....keep your families favorite recipes on the app, so its easier to add again. I absolutely LOVE this app....it has helped me lose the weight i need to lose by making it easy to track my calorie intake and exercise. Great tool for anyone who wants to stay healthy :)
1715, An American student (Elija Wood- THE ICE STORM, THE GOOD SON, SIN CITY, LOTR) arrives at Oxford in hopes of enlisting the help of a famous philosophy professor (John Hurt- ALIEN, 1984, V FOR VENDETTA). After an uncomfortable introductory meeting, the two men are caught up in a murder mystery when a serial killer begins a deadly game of insane logic. THE OXFORD MURDERS is a smart mystery / thriller, in which the characters actually use deduction and reasoning to solve the crimes! There is also a central debate between philosophy and mathematics. Can truth be known? Does it even exist? Is everything ordered in some elemental way, or is everything random and chaotic? If you enjoy stories w/ a bit more for your brain to chew on, like Sherlock Holmes for instance, then this should fit right in. Highly recommended...
1716, Purchased this just to see if it would work because every year when we run our Land Rover thru Emissions Testing after they test our Fuel Cap it starts throwing codes for the cap. Land Rover Caps cost 39.99 & get to be expensive after awhile. Besides this cap fits better & is much easier for my wife to use.Positives:1. So cheap I can keep an extra in vehicle if it starts going bad.2. Fits & seals better than the Genuine Land Rover cap.Negatives:1. Doesn't feel as solid as the OEM Cap but time will tell.2. Doesn't attach to tether strap as OEM cap & I don't see an easy way to attach it for accidental loss.I will try to update after longer use.
1717, Some of the things that happen to these people are terrifying, and I would hate to be in there shoes when that was happening, I love a good ghost show that's real and actually have happened to people, it opens your eyes to what's really going on around us, but we just haven't noticed, I sometimes prefer the storytelling instead of the idiots going around with a camera and running at every little sound that's made (which half of the noises are made by them stomping about) the storytelling is just easier to follow, but don't get me wrong I like to hear the EVP's and things of what the ghosts say and they have that on this show, the people who are being haunted call in experts so you see some camera action and get to hear things on the recorder, but all in all if you enjoy paranormal shows about ghost, but get dizzy with all the camera movement, this is your show, I just hope they come out with season 3 soon...
1718, ....a new Marvellous Motown Marvin Gaye compilation.This updates all the others in that it includes the great &quot;Sexual Healing&quot;. It is outstanding in that it also boasts the eleven plus minute version of &quot;Got to Give it Up&quot; and &quot;You're The Man&quot; pts I AND II...and it is a Motown endorsed product. There are many greatest hits CDs which do not represent any love or respect for the artist--just a not too subtle way of making $$$ off an artist's name. This has been composed and reprocessed with avoiding that in mind. It comes off very well. Don't be fooled by imitation Marvin Gaye products. Evvy Marvin Product is not authenticated--it's got to be either Motown, Motown endorsed, Columbia or Columbia endorsed.... My advice is to always, always try to find the original album in CD form and then go to the various compilations. This is a good collection of a great artist. And it is priced right.
1719, I love this Olay product, it's made it so easy to use sunscreen everyday. I came across the Olay UV Defense Regenerating Lotion SPF 15 a few years ago, and haven't looked back. I have acne prone skin, but this sunscreen doesn't feel or look like an oil slick on my face, and it doesn't make me break out... these characteristics are very important to me. Despite the addition of fragrance as the last ingredient in the ingredient list, it's a delicate fragrance, and surprisingly doesn't irritate my skin.  Great UVB *and* UVA protection from the Avobenzone.  I went to Hawaii with this sunscreen in tow, and I came back from the vacation as white as I left (this is a good thing! I'd like to delay skin resurfacing procedures as long as I can!). Highly recommend trying this lotion if you're looking for a sunscreen that won't make your face all shiny.
1720, First the good: It seems well made, pumps very easily and moves a decent amount of fluid with each pump.The bad: It says it fits quart containers but it would not screw on to my Redline quart bottles. I also had a gallon jug to pump out (which it did not fit on either) and while doing so, the pick up tube dropped off into the jug. Naturally the tube is an odd size and nothing I could find laying around the garage would fit on there so I ended up cutting off the top of the jug to retrieve the tube so I could finish the job. The end result was quite a mess of gear oil all over the garage floor. If you buy this product make sure the bottom tube is pushed in place tightly!!!
1721, I had originally been sent a sample of this serum through the mail. I used it one night without thinking it would do much-- I was wrong. I am 23 and I am starting to notice my skin look a little dry, not quite as tight, and just not what it used to. This made my skin feel so soft and smooth and tight in the morning. I will definitely continue to use this--hopefully this will prevent my aging as I go into my late 20s and 30s. I'm not sure how this works for older ladies-- hopefully you can read the other reviews for that. This is pretty reasonably priced and it lasts a good time for me.
1722, I downloaded this for free and I have to say I am impressed by it.  There are a few glitches on my Kindle Fire where the screen is partially hidden and I can't see all of the data (net carbs etc.) However that is minor in comparision to the great resource this product is. I can find almost every food and portion and have it remember or save the meal if it is one that you repeat daily or often.  However this feature isn't the easiest to figure out. It needs a help guide and it needs a way of allowing you to imput ingredients for food you prepare yourself.  I haven't yet figured it all out yet but I have found it useful and I use it daily to track my intake.  Compared to the others I have seen this is really good.
1723, I bought this hand soap after discovering what a joy Mrs. Meyer's housecleaning products are to use.  I love that the company is truly green, that they don't use animal products, and that there is no harsh chemical smell because they don't use harsh chemicals.  Cleaning, whether your home or yourself, is all about staying healthy and fresh, scent included.  Unfortunately, this new parsley scent smells more of an artificial honeydew perfume, muddled with something unpleasant that I haven't been able to put my finger on.  If pleasant soaps are one of your small joys in life, then this scent is not for you.
1724, Like all Mrs. Meyer's products, which make doing chores a little less onerous with their lovely essential oil scents, the dish soap smells great. Basil and radish are my personal faves, though it's hard to pick just one. The dish soap, however, doesn't work up any suds....making it difficult to do the dishes manually without using a ton. And this stuff isn't cheap. So I'll just be sticking to regular Dawn for the dishes, and leave Mrs. Meyer's for the countertop spray and the abrasive cleaner for my bathroom.
1725, This is still a great concert to watch after 24 years!  However, I think the filmakers should have chosen a better day, weather-wise, to videotape this show, because the camera shows many picture imperfections due to the weather at the time.  Throughout the video, there are thick streaking black lines across the picture that I can only describe as images that look like branches (no joke!).  It seems evident from one particular camera on stage with the band, almost as if there's something on the lens.When and if they release this show on DVD, it needs to be cleaned up considerably.  But for now, this being all that's available, it's still a classic U2 concert, before the band sold out to their '90's "pop" image!
1726, My daughter is 3.5 years old and I have been looking for a large enough sturdy bathtub for her.This one is just perfect in every aspect.It is large and deep enough for a toddler and very comfortable and stylish.My daughter is thrilled with it and loves her bathtime in her new Primo Euro Bath.It is easy enough to empty out the water and it fits perfectly in a standard bathtub.Definately a good buy.I would not reccomend it to parents of a newborn or a small baby.This is more of a second baby bathtub.
1727, I like a good spy story.  This is a good story but it takes a while for them to get on with it.  There are 13 episodes but by episode 4 you can see the need for the saga to move faster.  But, if you hang in there and just relax with it, sooner or later you get where you need to go.  The security services in this country are portrayed in a very poor light, with the lack of inter-agency information sharing being right at the top of things.  Not very flattering to the government.  Perhaps another reason why the series was cancelled.  Overall, I enjoyed it, although I had to watch the whole thing twice.  Watching it twice allowed me to pick up on the nuances and small details--those things you miss when you are trying to follow the story.  Or maybe, I'm just thick!  Watch some of it and maybe you'll want to see it all.
1728, I really enjoyed the whole video. Some of the segments are really funny. I couldn't stop laughing. Other segments are dark and disturbing. They all give you a window into the creative mind of Michael Jackson. The movie opens with a production of Man In the Mirror, a mixture of a few different live performances from the Bad tour. The performances are so passionate you can feel the energy coming right through the TV. You can understand why people are fainting and crying! Lots of little gems in this video. The video was pressed overseas, but there weren't any flaws. The picture and sound quality are good.
1729, A talented and praised writer he may well be but Kim is not up there with the greats of Science Fiction. He has an enviable ability to understand geology or even the current ideas about reaching Mars and forming a colony. However, it fast becomes background noise to the farcical political fantasy that populates Mars with nearly every ethnic group who are mostly viewed as quaint at best. There are many rocks and foreigners who behave like rocks: "Dune" on Mars this is not.Characters there are in plenty but must we endure their every identical step taken across Mars? A long journey into the heart of a geological dictionary does not make for great Science Fiction. Yes, its clever at times but too often it pulled my attention away from the larger narrative.Red Mars has its moments of beautiful prose. A frustrating book by a talented author who needed a strict editor.
1730, This is a BIG tub, but it works. We put it on the counter between our double sinks so it is easy to use. I bought it because you can use it for newborns as well as toddlers. For small newborns it is not as comfortable, they kind of slide around a bit. I wish there were some kind of gripper for them to lay on, we use a towel so he doesn't slide around as much. It is nice and deep, which is good for boys just in case they pee, it doesn't make it out of the tub. I get annoyed at the plug to drain the water, the pressure of the water flowing through it closes it, so you have to hold it open to drain the water.
1731, This is one of Tom Clancy's best novels yet- and surprisingly it doesn't way over a pound. It misses the mark by 1 ounce. This book was actually created after The Hunt for Red October and Patriot Games, but is the first  in the series. It is- more or less- a prelude to the series. Amazingly  enough, Jack Ryan does not play a particuly big role in this book. But none  the less, Tom Clancy shows how one man can change from a normal citizen  into a cold-blooded killer who will stop at nothing to reach his goal. I  suggest this book to anyone who likes Tom Clancy and is willing to devote  some time to a book. This is one of my favorite books in the series right  next to The Hunt for Red October, which has to be the best.  This is just  the book to start off the series.
1732, In all truth I started out not liking this show and I couldn't tell you why.  It was certainly right up my alley as far as the kind of shows I like goes.  But as I got further into the series I have found that the story lines have gotten better and better which is unusual for a TV show.  Usually they start weakening by the third season.  So I wanted to go back and rewatch fron the beginning.  Thanks to Amazon I am able to do that.
1733, I walk for exercise, and this app tracks my route, distance, and time. It will continue to run and give me updates on how I'm doing while I listen to Pandora on my cell phone or pause to take photos of the flowers, trees, and butterflies. At the end of my walk, it tells me how far I've walked, what my route was, how long it took me, and how many calories I've burned. It doesn't nag, and it tells me &#34;Well done.&#34; I love it.
1734, I love this brand and have been trying all the different products.  I especially love the the hand soap.  The Geranium scent is very strong and very feminine.  You would not want this in your kitchen, I wouldn't think, or anywhere where men would be using it.  The scent reminds me of the talcum powder I used to have when I was young, the kind that came in a box with a puff.  Very floral and powdery.  The scent is strong enough to smell the minute I go in the bathroom, almost like there is potpourri in the room. The soap is not harsh at all and the container is great - you can use every last drop of the soap without having to add water.
1735, flash jumps around a bib in this adventure, but in the west his manner improved form deplorable to tolerably despicable.I don't think it would be amused with the O&H; show tune , I want to be an Indian too , wouldn't you?  Like a Sioux! .But he honest shows a slice of what the encroaching society effect were on the fictional charterers and there action and reaction to the new world . As far as the locals, heck it was their street corner so I won't make any judgment.
1736, ...and the episodes for this season got stronger and stronger throughout the season. Epilogue is an excellent episode.I thought this series ended too soon. It had fantastic talent not only in front of the camera, but behind it too.It was my favorite of the three SG series.It is good to see that the talent has gone on to other shows like Once Upon a Time, Longmire, and Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. that are successful.I highly recommend SG:U for your viewing pleasure. It is great TV.
1737, These Battery Tenders are miracle workers I think for low use vehicles, equipment, and toys.  I've at least half-dozen of these guys in use at given times.I've  hard-wired a pigtail in all low-use 12v battery-started equipment including my diesel pickup and keep on charge while not in use - these keep my batteries healthy.  They've also rejuvenated many.I figure amount of pocket change spent for charger vs a dead $ulfated battery is enough motivation to purchase and apply.Comes with two pigtail attachments, one made to hardwire  and another with alligator clips - both have fuses and positive-protected connectors.Kyle
1738, I have used this product several times through the last 15 years to treat my tinea versicolor.  While in the shower, I simply "shampoo" my skin in the affected areas.  Use more than you think you need to create a rich, thick lather, then let it sit on your skin for 5 minutes while you shave your legs or just soak in the shower.  Then simply rinse it off.  Two to three such applications is enough to completely eradicate my TV and keep it gone for 3-4 years.  No kidding!  When it eventually comes back, I perform this routine again and am TV free for another 3-4 years.  This is the only product I've found that works this quickly and effectively.  It's wonderful!
1739, I have been using this app for about a week and I am very happy with it.  It does run in the background (which I know some do not like) but I like that my fire gives me an unobtrusive little notice in the top left corner when I have something new to check on a few of my apps including Tweetcaster.When I see the notice, it takes only two simple touched of my finger on my fire and I am easily checking out my newest Tweets.  This allows me to keep on top of good deals being offered (including some great catches on free e-books) in a very timely manner.It also very easily opens links (from sources I trust)  and with one tap gives me a variety of choices of things that I can do with a link.  Retweeting, etc. is also very easy and fast.This is a well designed app that I find to be intuitive and a breeze to use.  I highly recommend if.
1740, This watch replaces a much more expensive one that I wore for many years.  I was pleasantly surprised to see the watch looks good.  The second hand and light are nice.  The band had to be adjusted, and I had to take it to a watch repair shop for that.  In adjusting the band it is important to know that the the way the latch sits on the wrist requires the adjustment to be made differently on each side of the latch.  It took a few tries, but in my case, seven links on one side and five on the other make the watch sit correctly.
1741, Clancy gets deeply personal and raw in the &#8220;origins&#8221; tale of the mysterious agent Clarke in this novel. Less layered in plot and more character driven than just about any other of his novels, this is a story of violence, pride, love, and revenge that centers on the subset of human culture that makes the dark news headlines: drug dealers, black ops, police corruption, and those that work around these areas with the murky goal of &#34;doing good&#34;. Not for the faint of heart, it is often graphically violent, and the &#8220;good guys&#8221; do not so much &#8220;win&#8221; as come out of it transformed into &#8220;darkly good&#8221; mediators of often covert justice.
1742, The last of Stevie's 80s albums, this one isn't as solid and robust as 1985's "In Square Circle," but, like any Stevie album, still has its share of redeeming moments. Features one of his best 80s ballads "You Will Know," and the funky "Dark 'N' Lovely" which sounds more like some of his late 70s/early 80s funk numbers rather than something from 1987. Also spawned a hit with "Skeletons" which is really not one of his better songs (very melodically bland). Still worth hearing if you're unfamiliar with it, as there is no such thing as a completely disposable Stevie Wonder album.
1743, I've aleady reviewed &quot;Gold&quot; earlier, so I am writing to all those people who asked for a &quot;Carpenters, Live in Concert&quot; DVD.  According to the Grant Guerrero website; there is a &quot;Carpenters, Live at Budokan, 1974&quot; DVD concert.  It was released in Japan in 2002.  It has the same content as the previously released VHS tape, which many Carpenter fans already own.  I am positive the sound and video have been upgraded to the DVD level. If you want to see this DVD, you either have to have an all-region DVD player, or a DVD player that will play Japan-coded DVDs.  I  sometimes wonder if A &amp; M/Universal has any regard for the USA Carpenter fans.  This is not fair.
1744, The shoes fit well but did not have the arch support I need...I wore them to work and lasted about 4 hours before my feet began to burn and ache...I contacted the seller and had no problem returning the shoes, even though I had worn them...would recommended buying from the seller as the customer service is superb...I bought a pair of shoes from them a couple of years ago and they were wonderful...These did not meet my needs as I work on concrete and require better arch support...Would recommend them for people who do not have flat feet..
1745, This film is by all means an art film.There is less emphasis on things like plot and theme and more emphasis on production,camera shots,humor and of course the music videos.Some of the visual effects are awesome as  well.The best videos are Fool On The Hill,Flying,I Am The Walrus and Blue  Jay Way.This film looks like a bunch of great scenes pilled on to each  other and thats the down fall of MMT.The scenes pop up suddenly without an  explanation.This makes the film to short (55 min). I think if they had more  footage of John and George it would be better too.But its still a great  film in the art sense.There are also 2 extra songs= They are orchestral  performances of She Loves You and All My Loving.
1746, This spy thriller makes you think. The reason it didn't last more than one season was probably due to that fact - people want their entertainment simiple and fitting a formula. This show deviates from the expected, leaving you wondering just who is doing what and why are they doing it. And the characters are not your usual mix. They are all slightly off so that sometimes you wonder if API is more of an insane asylum than a spy shop. The pace is a bit slow, but, in my mind, necessary for the plot development. This show and the actors deserved more than one season.
1747, Most products I've tried have left the nasty white streaks on my windshield when I turn on my wipers.  Not this stuff.  I actually added it to RainX Bug Wash the first time.  Then I added it to plain water when I ran the bug wash out.  Both times it left my windshield perfectly waterproof.  Best time to use it is when it's dry.  If you use it when it's raining it'll bounce off the water instead of going into the windshield.  I just spray a splash or two every time I start my car that way it's always ready in case it rains.  And when the thunderstorms come and people are pulling off the side of the road because their wipers can't keep up, you won't barely even need wipers since the rain beads up and runs off.  Perfect product!
1748, To begin let me tell your that I am 29 years old, but I never took care of my skin when I was younger; I was involved in sports and never used sunscreen or any moisturizer and let me tell you that all that was reflected on my face.  My skin is difficult (I have mild wrinkles, my skin is losing up and some parts of my face are oily while others are dried).  Before I tried this serum nothing worked very well on my face.  I tried every product that you can imagine(even derma e that has great reviews) without seeing results.  Now I am so excited to see what this serum is doing to my face.  This serum sure does ALL what it promises:regenerates skin,makes it glow of youth, not greasy, and mildly restores elasticity.  I saw results on my first application.  Oh, and the microdermabrasion and peel kit system is exellent too. I highly recommend this product!
1749, As the old saying goes.....Buyer BEWARE! This is for the die-hard Beatles Fans ONLY. The quality of the DVD is worse than poor. It's as if the copy was made from a recorded VHS televised airing of the movie. The sound quality of the songs, though, are very good. But. The video quality is beyond awful. At times, the video is washed out and unwatchable. I only paid $8.00 for my copy. I would recommend not paying more than $2.00. Unless you are a very die-hard Beatles fan and MUST have everything they've done. I'm sure in Time, an OFFICIAL release of this movie will come about.
1750, Characters is one of the lesser known albums in the Stevie Wonder catalog.  It would be a great album by most artist's standards, but it is a notch below what we've come to expect from Mr. Wonder.  There some great songs including &quot;Skeletons&quot;, &quot;Dark 'n' Lovely&quot; and &quot;You Will Know&quot;.  &quot;Get Up&quot; is a duet with Michael Jackson and the beat of &quot;With Every Beat Of My Heart&quot; is built around a sample of an actual heartbeat.  Stevie Ray Vaughan also guests on the album.  The album didn't sell well and became his first since 1972's Music Of My Mind to not hit the top ten and not contain a top ten single.  That streak included nine top ten albums (two number ones) and fourteen top ten singles (seven number ones).
1751, I like this diet helper. The guide for finding foods and their calorie content is really helpful. I gave it 4 stars and not 5 because it is less than easy to add foods to meals.  After every food you list you have to go back to the page where the meals are, lunch, dinner,etc.  So if I have 3 different things for breakfast, I have to return to the Breakfast listing 3 times to add foods.  Otherwise a great tool for me. June 23. As I use this it has become more friendly, and there is multiple food listings for meals.  I have lost 15 lbs. so far and I am Changing to 5 stars.
1752, Why I have bought this curling iron twice now.  I broke my first the other day trying to cool it off fast with water.  This curling iron is awesome because it has a long shaft so you can fit a good amount of hair in it if you want, it's got a big enough tip so that your fingers don't get burned, the heat setting can be as hot as hot can be for a quick curl, IT's PURPLE, it will turn off automaticly if left on by accident, but not so soon that you find yourself with a cold rod, it comes with a heat resistant cover so that if you must leave it cool, you can cover it so it won't burn anything, lastly my hair NEVER gets caught in the handle like it will with some others  The ONLY complaint, which isn't that big of a deal, I wish the cord was a little bit longer. =) This is a great buy!!!
1753, The three stars I gave this album have nothing to do with the music or lyrics of Marvin Gaye. What's Going On is an all time classic and brings great joy and insight whenever listened to. I have had several versions of this album since the early nineties... but this has to be the worst remaster I have ever heard. I don't consider myself an audiophile, rarely commenting on sound quality unless it's vastly improved or way below par, but to my ears the bottom end of this recording is completely stripped away. Even turning up the bass on fairly expensive speakers produces little to no low end on this recording (or simply a distorted low end). All of which is a shame, because the bass drives many of the tracks on this album. I have gone back to an older edition of this album just to enjoy it, but seeing that newer remasters are floating around out there (two since this edition), I may have to pick up one of the more recent releases and hope for the best.
1754, This album starts out with the 12 plus minute &quot;Earth Tones&quot;-starting itself with gentle nature sound effects and thenlurching into a deep,primal jazz/funk groove with Grover's saxpermateating every cravass in between!And a cover of the BillyStrayhorn classic &quot;Passion Flower&quot; is given a treatment notdissimilar to Coltrane.And then there's that title song-a moodilygrooving slice of funk with deep beats and light,sensual orchestration to die for!And the whole thing is capped off with&quot;Black Frost&quot; whitch does'nt change alot!'Mister Magic' swingsin and out of tempo's,from jazz to funk and back all in littlemor then half an hour and is CLEARLY Grover Washington's artiticstatement of intent!If only he were here today to make more musiclike this-I know alot of people who'd like to hear it.I would!
1755, This is basically a very cheap plastic case.. if you want to be cheap... go for it. The case always unsnaps itself randomly for no good reason. You have to somehow put it on just the right amount to get it not to unsnap. However, you still can easily unsnap the case off and I'm just glad the phone hasn't fallen out yet. The swivel clip is also very very hard to press down and take out the phone... You are going to have to have your fingers pushing on both ends of the clip in order to get the phone out of the clip. This is annoying when trying to answer a call or trying to get to a text message. The only pro about this product is that it's cheap.
1756, Great phone case for the Galaxy 4 with the thick Otterbox protective case! My hubby works construction and needed a phone case that was vertical and had the belt loop and was canvas, this phone fits the bill on all accounts! Some reviews said case was cheap, but for the money I paid, I did not think that way and I bought 5 of them to have extras on hand. Hubby is so happy with case as it fits his Galaxy 4 with the thick Otterbox cover comfortably! He says thay he doesn't even know he's carrying it as it is so comfortable in the vertical position instead of horizontal. Some reviews talked about removing the metal belt hook, but hubby said it didn't bother him. Also love the wide opening and heavy velcro flap to secure phone safely! Even with the thicker otterbox cover the phone slkdes in and out of the case with ease! Can't say enough, just love this case for the Galaxy4 with Otterbox cover!
1757, I've used a number of facial moisturizers over the years, expensive and drug store brands.  This is my favorite.  I am in my early 50's and have always had very dry skin, so it's tricky to find a moisturizer that works for me to the point where I only use night creams.  But this one is great!  It goes on silky smooth and doesn't feel heavy or greasy.  It absorbs quickly allowing for easy application of mineral foundation.  It also lasts all day for me without my skin ending up feeling tight and dry by the end of the day.  And within a week or so of starting to use it, my skin felt so much softer and smoother.  I highly recommend for anyone with very dry skin at any age.  LOVE IT!!
1758, Once baby had outgrown the sink, we were stuck using the one I originally registered for - a "space saving" model. HATED that one. Too much work. Read reviews and bought this one - baby is now 15mos and we are still using it. LOVE it. One tip - for small infants, use one of those big sponge things to keep baby from sliding around, or put a wet handtowel behind them. Oh, and I use to store it on the back of a door. Used one of those stick-on-hooks to hold it up. Worked great, out of the way & able to dry out. Buying this for all of my girlfriends for their baby showers.
1759, I have been using my fitnesspal for 2+ years. I access from my home PC, my work PC, my iPhone, and now my Kindle Fire.I find it intuitive and very functional.The food database is without equal. My mom and daughter made thumbprint cookies. I thought there was no way it was in the database, but much to my surprise it was!I love the bar code scan function on the iphone. Works perfect.We have some recipes we make a lot, so we just add them to my fitness pal so we have instant access to calories by serving.We recently added our own food (Smoked Brisket Soup) which showed up in the search list for the whole family. It took about five minutes from when we entered it until it was available for everyone using myfitnesspal.Cons :They dont offer a paid version that is ad free. I prefer to pay a little and skip the ads. However, this app is WORTH the ads!Great APP!!
1760, I've been an Olay user for almost 10 years now, and swear by this brand. In fact, this is the only brand that hydrates my super fussy sensitive/oily skin without making it breakout or leaving it too dry.I used this serum for a week, once a day around my nose area, eyes, laugh lines and frown lines, and put my regular total effects moisturizer over it. It didn't feel greasy, but the areas I put the serum definitely looked greasy, I had to dab extra powder. After a few days, I noticed I was getting breakouts in the areas I put the serum. Too bad, the serum feels good going on, and feels good staying on.So I'm using it just around my eyes for now. If you have oily/acne prone skin, you may want to stay away from this.
1761, I bought this album because of Mianfei's excellent review.  The cover photo predicted a mood like a refreshing dip in the river on a hot day.  Slint plays different music than I usually pop in the changer.  The guitars are dense like on "Nosferatu Man," trudging through a wasteland of useless emotional baggage.  The vocalist talks frequently with the volume mixed low, creating a dreamlike effect as the sonic landscape unfolds.  I was glad to have explored this surprisingly powerful music.  Enjoy!
1762, I have had many Bluetooth headsets and all of them had some sort of quirk or other. I have paid much more for some of the others than I paid for the Jabra BT-8040 but so far my Jabra is the best. I like the small size though I had smaller. It fits in my ear nicely and doesn't keep falling out of my ear like my last bluetooth, a Plantronics Discovery 925. I would like the volume to be a little louder. Also on occasion it acts strange when I try to do voice commands. I have to attempt 2 or 3 times to get it in voice command mode. Other than that it's a great little headset.
1763, This film is worth having just for Anna Moffo's performance and a great keepsake to remember her.  Bonisoli is handsome and a good Alfredo.  The setting is lush and costumes are wonderful.  No subtitles which is fine with me, but a newbie might enjoy the film with Stratas and Domingo a little more.  The style of acting is more &quot;look good for the camera&quot; as was the custom of the day (1968) and Anna has no trouble!  Her mastery of the vocal demands much superior to Stratas in the later Domingo film. Just listening is a joy.  A &quot;must have&quot; for any collector of Verdi.
1764, I bought this when a airline lost my luggage on the way to Kodiak, AK. I settled on this product, when I couldn't find a cheap Jojoba or Vit E. Oil at a local drug store. I used it at night only, since it doesn't include SPF. It seemed to be hydrating without being oily. I kept using it for a week at night, even after finding my luggage. I ended up trashing a full bottle due to breakout and a bit of a rash developing on my cheek. Back to Jojoba and La Posay Roche.This just reinforces why I never buy drugstore products.
1765, Fellow Carpenters Fans:This is the DVD release of the &quot;Yesterday Once More&quot; video, just redesigned. The quality is excellant and if you're a Carpenters fan you'll LOVE IT!It's sad for us US Carpenters fans that they are no longer releasing newer material. &quot;As Time Goes By&quot; was the last release and it was only released in JAPAN, excuse me, but... I thought the Carpenters were born and started in the USA???The last US release was the compilation CD &quot;Singles 1969-1981&quot;, another compilation!Richard is currently working on a Christmas album. Let's hope the US will see this!AlwaysCarpenterstoyou . tipod . com
1766, Without a doubt in my mind this is the greatest (hip hop) album of all-time from the greatest MC of all time.  This album has it all intense and meaningful lyrics, heart-pounding beats, catchy-soulful hooks and great collaborations.  Every record on this is either perfect or damn-near perfect, nobody makes music like this anymore.  Listening to this album will depress you knowing that Tupac Shakur is no longer here to follow up this classic album, but he spirit lives on within his last LP released (while he was still alive and had full imput on a project).  Rest In Peace Mr. Shakur we miss you more than you could ever imagine.
1767, I am in essence reviewing both seasons here.  This Stargate series was as good if not better than the Stargate Atlantis spin off and and better than some of the weak final seasons of the original Stargate.  Once McGiver left the series went down hill.  This series in the Stargate universe was actually very good.  The stories were quite believable.  (Of course they required the suspension of disbelief that all good science fiction requires.)  The characters were believable.  I particularly liked the super loyal top NCO.  He was hard core and your basic Marine hoorah type although I guess he wasn't a Marine.  I found the ending episode dissatisfying only because it left me wanting to see more, and I doubt if it will happen.  It deserves a final movie like Firefly got.
1768, Many of the mystery series we watch, particularly from the BBC, are so dark and gloomy that you feel like kicking the cat when the show is over, no matter how good the show was. A steady diet of that can get to you after a while. The Glades, on the other hand, is lighter stuff; not taking itself too seriously. It's fun to watch with a cast that is likeable and seems to get along with each other, at least on the show. While each show has its own story line, the series does carry over the developing relationships between the characters so there is a sense of continuity.Light and fairly airy but a nice change.
1769, The previews/lead up to "The Event" were interesting and I was looking forward to a riveting, well thought out and well acted new series. Not so. This series is boring, the dialog is boring and the acting is double boring. The writers are trying to create an edge of your seat build up moment, but it falls completely flat and left me with not even a warmed over feeling.So not worth it. I will be very surprised if this lasts for more than 1 season. Flash Forward was way better and wasn't on for more than a season.
1770, talk about Underrated&amp;Forgotten?Johnny Gill sings like nobody's Business&amp;the Brother is Mad Talented but he Gets No Love whatsoever.it's hard to believe that it has been a Decade since this Disc  came out.I used to Rock this One Before Going to The Club.Rub You The Right  Way was The Jam.Lady Dujour was The Cut Though.Combined with  Jam&amp;Lewis&amp;Babyface&amp;La Reid Johnny GIll Gives up the goods  here.Far&amp;Away His Best Album.He has been Stuck With 2nd Tier Throwaway  Material he is Above that.that Voice Deserves to Be Heard Fully Uncut.I  hope he can come back Because He Could Blow anything that's out now into  the Waters.this Cat has had Chops since he was 14 back when he was kicking  it with Stacy Lattisaw.
1771, Back in the day when popular music wasn't as polarized as it currently is, Lionel Ritchie ruled the airwaves as a man that could sing it all: pop, R &amp; B, funk, and a little country.  That is no more evident than in this 1986 release, the follow-up to his monstrously successful, Grammy-winning &quot;Can't Slow Down&quot;.Although &quot;Dancing&quot; did not sell as prolifically as its predecessor or garner as much acclaim, it is still a noteworthy achievement.  No less than six songs (the title cut, &quot;Se La&quot;, &quot;Ballerina Girl&quot;, &quot;Deep River Woman&quot;, &quot;Love Will Conquer All&quot;, and &quot;Say You, Say Me&quot;) were major chart-makers and the rest successfully complement the album.The 8:07 &quot;Don't Stop&quot; is no-holds-barred funk wonder, featuring  wonderful percussion work from the legendary Paulinho Da Costa and woman by the name of Sheila E.
1772, I read a newspaper article where it said that while they were tearing down the stage setup due to the companies that were supposed to be doing so could not show up until later actually found some real unexploded ordinance from the original bombings by the Nazis underneath the planking and stage areas of the Potsdamer Platz Plaza, whether this real stuff was preserved was of unknown origin but I also heard that it surprised the hell out of Roger Waters but I don't know if this is true or not but I think that I remember seeing him say so in a documentary that I saw him in later. This is a fantastic/amazing concert. I own a copy of it.
1773, My daughter's birthday is in early August so I get an e-mail via  Amazon saying "These"! Interpretation: Mom, I want these because the fit is so perfect for my wide feet, and they are gorgeous in the black. Perfect for my calves, and they feel like they've already been broken in. The comfort for a new boot is amazing. I'll be able to perform without worry about blisters in these beauties. Result: I immediately ordered the boots at a great Amazon price with free shipping. I did have her try them on even though she said that she knew the fit would be great. They were! I was impressed by the detailing on these boots, even to the color of the lining. I also loved the roomy round toe. She did have me order these 1/2 size larger than her normal size, but I'd attribute that to the different styles of Ariat boots.
1774, Thoroughly mindblowingly brilliant, as in almost all things the Fab Four did.  Five stars if only for the performance of &quot;I Am the Walrus&quot;  (&quot;No You're Not!&quot; Said Little Nicola) and the off-kilter  eccentricities of the Men of the Century (Liverpool edition).  Play LOUD  and take with lots and lots of tea.  And biscuits.It'll all make  perfect sense, if you are ready and willing.  Otherwise, better not to  worry about it.God bless the Beatles and all those who sail with them.
1775, I am a tester for New Trent -- They sent me this, and I loved how it slid right into my pocket.  It comes with a soft bag case, but I find I never use those.Occasionally the LED or the laser would turn on, in my pocket, but the good thing is they auto-shutoff after about 30 seconds.After about 3 weeks of use, my device would not charge anymore.  Then it started emitting a high pitched noise while it was connected to power.I had to send my device back, and since I am a tester, I don't get a replacement.  New Trent acknowledged that a small number of their devices do have this problem.So while it worked, it worked awesome!
1776, I ordered this because the Microsoft one is super over-priced, but in the end, it just would have been better to get the Microsoft one. (or better yet use HDMI if that is an option) The overall build feels cheap, and looks cheap, but that doesn't always mean it is cheap, this time however, it did. It works, I'll give it that, and it even came with a nifty little adapter/extender for the Audio cable, but the image is in triplicate, the main image in the middle, then a ghosted image on both sides. It isn't so bad that you couldn't play but it definitely gets annoying super fast. Just bite the bullet and get the Microsoft one, or get a new monitor for Christmas that has HDMI input like I did.
1777, When an artist releases a box set spanning his entire career and includes almost all of one album in the set, that disc must be his best, right? Well I must say I was greatly surprised.Is Innervisions a fantastic album? Yes. I would trade just about any modern R &amp; B CD for it. However, I must say Innervisions is greatly overrated. I must say that I personally enjoyed Talking Book, Fulfillingness First Finale and Songs In The Key of Life. It has some classic cuts on the album, but it just does not seem as timeless as some of his other recordings of the time. My verdict; I would rather have Talking Book or FFF over this one, but it still has an important place in anyone's Stevie Collection.
1778, Stevie Wonder is just one of those singers who you know as a living legend. He's accomplished so much in the music world (as well as out). 3 or so years ago I hadn't listened to any of his albums except the glorified piece of art Songs in the Key of Life. In comparison this album isn't as socially-conscious but it's also not as overproduced. Most of the songs deal with love's ups and downs. I think the album is strongly overlooked.Album Moods: Heartbroken, In Love, Everyday Sadness, Yearning, Betrayal4.6 starsDOWNLOAD:&#34;Cryin' Through The Night&#34;&#34;Dark 'N' Lovely&#34;&#34;Free&#34;&#34;One Of A Kind&#34; &&#34;With Each Beat Of My Heart&#34;
1779, 3.3 starsThe extras here feature various cast etc saying that they were going for Gladiator-but-bloodier here. They got mostly the blood, as this lacks much of Gladiator's feel and vision. What it does have is buckets of CGI blood spurting from every wound!The blu-ray is so clear that the crazy amounts of blood are silly enough, but then they had to make them even more crimson in post? Ridiculous and really b-movie in a bad way, often negating some occasionally decent performances. West is good, but I just can't stop from thinking "McNulty with a sword!" every time I see him.Perhaps far too accurate in some ways, Centurion is for those who like their films to look like video games, blood and guts and all. I prefer some subtlety and suggestion over rampant naked gore, but each to their own.A must-see for serious slash and hack fans in any case.
1780, You can easily imagine how Norton Juster's whimsical, punning, and perfectly logical book might have appealed to Chuck Jones; his adaptation of Juster's "The Dot and the Line" had won an Oscar. Parts of this occasionally doleful transfer are effective, and the vocal talent is impeccable: Mel Blanc, Hans Conreid, June Foray. But the musical score is almost unbelievably poor (Leonard Maltin's capsule review refers to the songs as "icky"), the character designs pale in comparison with the nifty pen-and-inks Jules Feiffer drew for Juster's book, and Jones's Milo runs his hand through his forelock so often you want to break his wrist. Worth seeing, for Juster's admirers and Chuck Jones fanatics. But only once.
1781, Well as far as a film goes this is pretty stupid. However, I own a copy &amp; would never trade it in.I'm a Beatles fan - &amp; if I look at this not as a film but as a collection of music videos then it's well worth it - especially for &quot;I am the Walrus&quot;.There's no screenwritting credits for this because there was no real script. Paul McCartney &amp; Ringo Starr decided to fill a bus with interesting people - &amp; film it - &amp; wait for the magic to happen.The magic never happened in so far that a 'movie' didn't emerge - just a lot of disjointed imagery.But this is a must for a Beatles nut like myself.
1782, I decided I was done with expensive, fragranced moisturizers I could only find at the department stores.  This body moisturizer smells nice and gives a nice glow to the skin without being greasy.  Application feels very luxurious and I wondered whether it would be too emollient but it soaks into the skin nicely while leaving a moist appearance to the skin which lasts pretty much all day.  Some moisturizers I could feel sitting on my skin all day - even once I'd get into bed at night, like I had a layer of plastic coating on my skin but Aveeno Creamy Moisturizing Oil seems to be perfect.  Usually, I don't get through one bottle of any product before I move on, however, I just purchased my third bottle of this.  I think it's a keeper!
1783, I USUALLY DON'T SHOUT IN MY REVIEWS BUT THIS IS SERIOUSLY THE BEST STUFF ON EARTH!Okay seriously though, I've used this stuff for around 5 years now and my skin has never felt better. The lotion is light yet tough enough to deal with almost any skin condition, especially dry skin. I have mild acne and it doesn't cause additional breakouts. The scent is amazing and I wouldn't be surprised if that was the &#34;stress relief&#34; part of it.I also use this after shaving, peels, Retin-A, etc. This heals your skin within hours. A 12-ounce bottle lasts 6-8 months. I used to be a Vaseline junkie, and I still like their products, but nothing beats this lotion. NOTHING.
1784, Since I originally reviewed this product, the price has actually gone... up? If you can buy this stereo BT set for $40 and under, snap it up. Otherwise, pass on it.I was a little skeptical about buying a stereo Bluetooth for such a bargain, but this is a nice headset. Mind you, it's not perfect, but the sound is reasonably good. It you are expecting the sound quality of Shure headphones, your expectations are not realistic. However, this headphones do offer fairly accurate mid-range response, fair bass, and decent highs. I use them with my iPhone 3G S and have found that the "jazz" setting for the EQ produces the best results. The attachment for the "2nd ear' works great and is very unobtrusive. I think it would be hard to beat this product for any stereo Bluetooth under $75.
1785, While I enthusiastically recommend this Flashman volume, I can't agree with Gryphon that it one of the two best.  The original Flash, Flash at the Charge, Mountain of Light, and Flash and the Dragon are all better, IMO.  The major problem with Redskins is that it's divided into two distinct halves, each covering two different and widely separated historical periods.  As a result, it has the marked feel of two books tossed together as one because they both happened to deal with the American West.  Like Gryphon, I preferred the first half over the second.  The second, which deals with the Little Big Horn, smacks of too much borrowing from Little Big Man.  (The same derivative flaw which tainted Royal Flash, which is, in my view, the worst of the series).  Still, it's the largest of the 10 and broad and entertaining in its scope.  Don't miss it.
1786, It ia definetly very fun. I like it better than the deluxe version...but I think they should add one thing. I think that when you get to a certain height, the background should change. so like when you get to 3,000 meters it changes to running up seaweed and the background is the ocean or something. then at that point it woukd be fish swimming by instead of squirrels. and octopuses are the birds....something like that. Then when you got to 6,000 meters it could be in a desert or in space...etc. I think that would make the game a lot more interesting. I don't like the difficulty of the deluxe, so they should add the background feature to THIS game.
1787, This product is great. Little pricey but well worth the money. I work in South Texas in the Oilfield we have this particular product in about 55 worktrucks and it works as advertised. Sometimes we only have one or two bars and it boosts my iphone to full bars and 3g. i experienced less lag using facetime or looking up stuff on safari. It doesn't matter what service provider,Sprint, Verizon or AT&T it is 800 MHz 1900 MHz compatible. A great, great product. This will boost multiple phones or 3G iPads. Also have seen it do great for the iPhone 5 on 4g as well. You will not be disappointed. Unless you live in a real remote area.
1788, My hubby and I had finally decided that we wanted to get pregnant so I used this app to track my cycle and ovulation days.  I did not over obsess with it all but I def used this app to change a few minor things to help us get prego sooner.  For instance during the days that were my high fertility days I would make sure to try every other day so he would have a good opportunity to rebuild good swimmers.  I also would try to change those days up a little each month to try to target my ovulation day a little better (since you really are aiming for ovulation day plus or minus a few days).  I am sure each woman will have her own benefits and trends that can be used along with this app
1789, These are great bottles. I used them from day one until 6 months old. The only reason I don't use them anymore is my daughter is interested in holding her own bottle sometimes now and plastic is easier for her to hang onto because it's lighter. I love the glass bottles though because they keep the milk cool longer, important when pumping at work and using one of those little coolers. And they heat the milk up faster when placed in a warm water bath. They're very sturdy - I've dropped them several times and they haven't cracked or chipped. These come with nipples and the covers. I highly recommend these.
1790, As soon as I bought this back in '96 I was instantlyhooked on it.he ranges from all different subjects like Gangsta -"Ambitionz az a ridah","Got my mind made up","2 of amerikaz most wanted" I could go on...He goes on to talk about the ladies - "All About U", "Skandalouz","How Do U Want It", "thug Passion" and"rath Be Ya Nigga"...On one particular song "Wonda why they call U Bitch"he talks about prostitutes and how they areruining their lives...this isnt all about Gangsta but this shows how angry, confused and hurt he is deep inside.This is and always will be a hip hop classic -the beats, the subject matter, the emotion.IF YOU DONT OWN THIS YOU ARE NOT A HIP HOP FAN!
1791, there are a number of misunderstandings about this product:what it is:  it is a washer fluid concentrate where you add 4 oz per gallon of water.... you don't need anything else unless you are using it below freezing...  so in warm climates its an all in one productantifreeze:  if you need to use it in sub freezing weather, just add 1/2 bottle of rubbing alcohol and it works fine down to about -20Fyou can add it to washing fluids if you want, but seems like sort of a waste of moneyIMPORTANT:  the rain x effect is cumulative with this product, it builds up over time and stays at its best when you always use it, not just every other bottle or whatever....  I live in FL, use this in plain water every time and nothing else, and my windshield  sheds water like crazy, I almost never need to use the wipers....  if you USE IT CONSISTENTLY IT WORKS PERFECT
1792, After the DuckTales series came to an end, Disney had hoped to bring the adventures of Scrooge McDuck and crew to the big screen. The Ducktales The Movie: Treasures of the Last Lamp was a complete fop in 1990. I remember seeing the movie at my local theater when I was a kid. The movie is only available on DVD through the Disney Movie Club (which I'm a part of) and the Disney Movie Rewards.The DuckTales movie has Scrooge, his nephews (Huey, Dewey, and Louie), his adopted niece, Webbigail, and Launchpad on an adventure to find a golden lamp.The movie is still great to watch after all these years.
1793, This is one of the best jam bands ever at their peak.  Sadly they broke up after the DVD was done and never played with the original lineup again-which is a pity.  Steve Winwood and Jim Capaldi made great music together-not that Capaldi has passed on, this DVD is an opportunity to see them perform.  The obly drawback to this DVD is that the cinematographer did a "psychedlic" shoot for part of the DVD, with swirls and other such remnants of the era. If you are willing to overlook this stupidity, then this DVD is worth it to you.
1794, Stevie Wonder speaks in the language of music - whether you like r&b, jazz, soul, funk, or rock you will be able to appreciate him - he is one of the great entertainers of all time. His voice is so bright and soulful and his instrumental talent is incredible. 'Innervisions' is  a very well-crafted album that gels together and seems to be an even greater expression than the monumental 'talking book' - I would recommend both albums - this one just seems to be the crowning achievement.
1795, I have been using this K&N filter in my 2012 Nissan Frontier 4x4 since the first oil change. The &#34;wrench-off&#34; feature is an awesome addition that all filters should have (in my opinion), and it makes taking the filter off easier if you unintentionally put a little too much &#34;stink&#34; on it the last oil change. After having used many other brands of filters in other vehicles, I'm pretty much sold on K&N and use their filters in both of my motorcycles as well. FYI - I use this filter in conjunction with Royal Purple 5W30.
1796, Although this album came out one year prior to my birth, it is an album that remains apart of my growing up, just as much as Romper Room was.  &quot;Isn't She Lovely&quot; is a song that my father used to play for me as a child, and if I ever have a daughter, it will be played for her too!Songs like &quot;Knocks Me Off My Feet, &quot;Summer Soft&quot;, &quot;As&quot;, &quot;If It's Magic&quot;, and all the rest of the jewels of music on this CD are timeless classics. There is a song for everyone and everything on this CD; there's classical music- &quot;Village Ghetto Land&quot;; gospel-&quot;Have a Talk With God&quot;; (almost)jazz- &quot;Easy Goin' Evening (My Mama's Call); EVEN latin and Zulu tongues- &quot;Ngiculela- Es Una Historia (I Am Singing).  All bases covered!This CD is a classic, and a must have for music lovers!!!
1797, My 98 toyota Sienna has 135k miles and recently got a engine check light (CEL).  The code was P0420 (catalytic converter).  A new CAT is expensive, so I gave CRC a try.  I put a bottle of CRC to the gas and followed the instruction.  I also reset the CEL using a OBD II scanner.The result:The smog numbers (CO,HC,O2) were improved by about 5 to 10% but not enough to pass the California smog check.
1798, I bought the iTorch to charge my iPhone while on the Appalachian Trail. I tested it 6+ times to ensure the weight was worth carrying since weight is a premium when you are carrying everything on your back. I have gotten 2+ charges to 95-100% so well worth the weight since it can be a 5-10 days between places to charge on AT. The unit is easy to use, the blue lights keep you informed of the charge available and the red LED light is an added bonus.  I am very pleased with the quality!  I did contact New Trent with a question and they were very quick to respond and were most helpful.  If you need a lightweight battery charge, the iTorch is an excellent choice.
1799, Haven is an excellent Sci-Fi, mystery television series that airs on SyFy. Earlier seasons can be viewed through various online outlets.Audrey Parker, a paranormal curious FBI agent, is sent to the town of Haven to investigate a strange case. Here she experiences some unusual events and a possible link to her mom. After successfully closing her case in Haven, the police Chief invites Parker to stay on with a promise of aiding in her search for her mother.Local police officer, Nathan, pairs up with Parker to solve various other crimes with weird circumstances. Parker finds more clues and Haven citizens connected to her past.What I really enjoy about Haven is the mature story line and characters. A lot of the available paranormal shows are geared for a younger, teenage type audience. This one is not. And the writing is not drowned in romantic anxiety or all the other cliche material found elsewhere. It is original content. I find it very entertaining and it satisfies my adult side.
1800, I can't tell you how much this product saved me from damaged hair and hundreds and hundreds of dollars and time going to the salon. I tried getting highlights at the salon but I could barely tell and my hair was fried, brittle and fell off.I have used Sun-In for 10 years and it is literally incredible. I have medium brown hair that looks like pencil led. With Sun-In all throughout my hair I have golden to platinum blonde hair and have had my whole life. My hair was blonde during childhood. During adolescents it got darker. Sun-In makes my hair shiner and the day after I use it, I have a GOOD hair day. It does take time to sit and use a hair dryer but beats going to the salon and paying $70!! In the summer it is super easy when you are out at the pool.This product is my favorite product of all time THANK YOU SUN-IN
1801, I have worn Easy Spirit AP1's for years. I have bony ankles and these shoes are cut low, so as not to hit the bones. They have great traction and the leather lasts and lasts. I generally pay $70, so $53 is a great price. The white leather does get dirty. You can throw them in the washer. (NOT the dryer, of course). I have found that they can be polished with the good, old fashioned "Hollywood Sani-White" that we used to use for children's and nurses' white leather shoes. (Shake well before using!) This does get chalky, so I then buff them and spray on a clear polish. I've removed the sockliner and replaced it with magnetic insoles. My feet and knees never hurt anymore. Ten stars!!
1802, My son is 7 months old...we've been using it since he was approx. 1 month. We used one of those "bear" shaped bath sponges to support him a little when he was tiny, but we're still using this tub and we love it! He's now able to sit up and play in it. I can see we'll be using it for a while! It's a good investment. It is large....you'll need space to store it or in our case we just keep it in the tub in our extra bathroom! You and your baby will love it!
1803, Not Clancy's finest work, but eventually became a gripping page-turner for me. I guess it took me a while to get into the story because I kept thinking that the background story of Clark just didn't need to be told. But... once I got past that hurdle and the overly quick development of the love interest between John and Pam, I really got immersed in the story and the parallels Clancy was drawing between the foreign war and the casaulties of the hidden war still raging on American soil in our inner cities.I knocked a star off for the gratuitous insertion of the Ryan family into the story. I mean, come on!
1804, These have become my favorite 'knock-around' slacks.  They are comfortable, with well designed pockets with flaps that don't stick out and catch on things like some cargo pants I have had.  The stitching is well done.  The material is fairly soft, and is very slightly on the thin side of medium, but not to the point where they feel cheap.  I will say, though, that if you are looking for heavy duty work pants, you will probably need to find pants with thicker material.  The sizing seems to be slightly off.  I usually wear 34 x 34's, but the 34 waist was way too roomy, and I instead went with the 32&#34; waist, which seems ever so slightly tighter than my other 34&#34; waist pants.  I am going to get a couple more pairs, and the price is definitely right on these.
1805, Great app. Food logging, as useful as it is, can be a real pain. This app makes it pretty easy.  The food database is huge and expanded through user data entry.  I rarely have to enter a new food, but when I do its pretty easy.  There are a few things I would see changed (see below) but overall I love the app. Can't figure out why its free, as there are no ads or offers.  It's worth paying forYou have to press a few to many buttons to enter meals, especially when you are using new foods.It adds exercise calories as a deduction, which I don't like and wish I could opt out of that (I am more concerned about meeting calorie goals)  so I log exercise separately).None of these lower my 5 * rating.
1806, In Square Circle makes it plain that the 70's are over(at least in the case of Stevie's music),but his melodic gifts makes this a worthwhile album and the best of his musical phase that began with the post-Musiquarium  period.Part Time Lover is a deserved #1 song(as well as his last),and  Overjoyed is the most beautiful song ever recorded.Other strong cuts  includes I Love You Too Much,Whereabouts,&amp;Never In Your Sun.Go Home  about the love rejected,now regretted scenario may have sounded good on  paper but doesn't hold up on repeated listens.The albums weakest moment are  his social conscience songs(Spiritual Walkers,The Land of LaLa,It's  Wrong)showing how much we miss the Stevie Wonder of Innervisions.ISC may  not have the soul of his 70's recordings,but his heart is in the right  place.
1807, I've enjoyed the "Delicate Sound of Thunder" (DSOT) ever since it came out.  The music is quite spectacular and most songs were performed with unusual passion (especially the sets with the saxaphone player and the  backup girls in `The Great Gig in the Sky').  What I found distracting was  the way it was filmed.  There were far too many slow-motion shots and I got  sick of the camera focusing on the fans' reactions.  That's where "Pulse"  is superior -- the camera work is seamless and focused on the light show  and the group, just as I did when I saw the live concert.  Make no mistake,  DSOT should be high on your list, and absolutely belongs in your library.  I watch "Pulse" for a true concert experience, and DSOT for the inspiring  performances.  Between 1 and 10, DSOT gets a solid 8.
1808, I don't review apps often, but this is a good one. I can't really think of much I would change about it. Sometimes you do get too many choices, I guess. E.g., to open a url,I have had to click three different options. But it loads fairly fast, so that's a minor inconvenience.I've used other Twitter options before, but so far this is my favorite one. And I know I haven't even explored all the options yet.Oh, I know. My one complaint so far is the inability to subscribe to people via text. I do that a lot. So now I just text &quot;follow twitteruser&quot; instead. That workaround is a little annoying, but I think the rest of it is good enough to make up for it.
1809, After buying Olay Regenerist Regenerating Serum Moisturizer at a local store, I found I liked it better than any other facial product.  It is not greasy, there is no fragrance that I can detect, and it easily allows a bit of makeup if desired.  EIght pumps of the bottle and that will cover my neck and face for the entire day.  For anyone who does not want heavy or expensive products, this is the one.  I like it so much that I added it to my recurring Amazon.com order list.
1810, This is without a doubt the best smelling hand soap in the world. The green apple scent smells just like green apple jolly ranchers. You'll want to wash your hands even more, just so you can smell this awesome fragrance. Until i recently discovered the touchless soap dispensers I had this on every sink in my house....and as soon as i figure out the right formula to use this in a touchless dispenser...I'll be right back on the Mrs Meyer's green apple band wangon! LOVE IT!!!!
1811, So these tights are tighter than most tights I own and when I take these off, they leave my legs feeling like they've been squeezed to death. My legs are not big (based on the size chart I am on the smaller end of the Small/Medium range) so I think this would be hard to fit larger legs. The waistband is rather tight as well, unlike my other tights. These make me look like I have love handles which I don't. I'll only be wearing these with black leotards since it really shows the lines and love handles when I wear light-colored leotards.
1812, So I've read a bunch of reviews where the comments are quite negative. Hummmm, I wholeheartedly disagree. I found this book riveting and amazing. The characters' development widens, and there is plenty of action. Many will say that the plot slowed down, but I found that the story base broadened out. Dragons were the main plot, even though they were seldom part of the action. All over the world, people were speaking about these dragons and plotting how to either use them or abuse them. It was like everyone was "dancing" with the idea of dragons. I found all five of the books great. The writing was excellent. I wish Martin would finish the series (and soon!). And I wish I could find more authors like Martin. Any suggestions???
1813, My son uses this program online when we are home and on the kindle when we are away and have internet. He uses the app on my Droid phone when we do not have internet. It is a terrific app listing items by product name.  Many items are listed, and others can be put in equivalent items. It sets up your goal calories. Exercise can be listed and the amount of calories from it are subtracted from food claories taken in. It is the best weight loss assistant I have ever seen.
1814, This is the best VHS out their with a collection of music videos featuring Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble also Live Performences. I would rate this a 5 because this could not get any better the music videos are really cool this is a must have for an SRV fan. My favorite is Couldnt Stand The Weather when SRV is playing his custom hamilton guitar in a rain storm very cool! I also like the western side of Change It. This is such a cool movie I hope they can release this sometime on DVD it would be sweeter so enjoy!
1815, A couple bad choices in the celebrity lineup:  Sinead (she looked bored, out of place) and Van Morrison (his voice was shot).  All the rest were fine to excellent.  Even Lauper, who I am not a fan of, didn't annoy me with her energetic performance. As usual Roger put together an awesome backing band.  BTW, I don't think Roger gets adequate credit for his vocals.  His voice is very strong and he handles the high stuff really well.  Bravo to him for putting together this amazing production and the DVD captures it well.  I won't watch it as often as his In The Flesh Live DVD (which is flat out spectacular) but I'm certainly glad I bought it.
1816, No Ordinary Family was one of the greatest shows of the 2010-2011 season. It didn't dissapointed me at all, because the main cast is just amazing.The plot is fresh, and it's (actually) a renovation of the whole superpower fiction. This first (and only season) is exciting, mysterious and it didn't tried too hard to be liked, because the ones we saw it know what i'm talking about. I wish it would come back for a second season, but ABC always makes wrong decisions that are about to be regret, because No Ordinary Family had better chances to improve than other veteran shows that just keep recycling stuff.This show is a "must buy" if you like science fiction, and of course "no ordinary" plots.
1817, ah yes...grover washington, jr.mister magic......this is that thang here! that 70's jazz-funk is a beautiful thang yall!!! brother gro' done did some damage with this one!i have a couple other grover cd's but mostly his late 80's work... but this time period was a good time for urban music (until disco blew up and jus got outrageous! - but disco grew outta this type of stuff...)i love hip hop and sampled music, but this is where that stuff finds its origins: grown folks with real instruments workin up a sweat!can you dig it???
1818, Minus one star for the constant popups asking you to upgrade or downloadother software from this company.Other than that, when you are playing blackjack, this is a great and authenticgaming application that also appears to give you a fair deal. In the last few monthssince downloading I have build a pretty good bank of over $80K, and risen to thetop 8% in all players standings. You cant do that with a corrupt app like Big FishCasino who will deal you a 14 on 15 straight deals. LOLThis is a great app, give it a try.
1819, When I read a bio on Stevie Wonder,many made a fuss about Songs In The Key Of Life being overdue since his last album(Fullfillingness..)came out two years earlier.Since then many of his album were years between  releases.Characters came out a mere &quot;TWO YEARS&quot; after In Square  Circle.At first listen it was Wonder-bliss.Unfortunately,repeated listens  showed he should have taken more time with developing this one.No doubt  Skeletons is a jam &amp; a half,but many songs are mediocre(Get  It&lt;w/Michael Jackson&gt;,Dark N' Lovely,Crying Through The Night,My Eyes  Don't Cry)as well as downright ridiculous(Galaxy Paradise,In Your  Corner).Others are worth a listen(You Will Know,With Each Beat Of My  Heart,One Of A Kind),especially the buried nugget Free that salvage this  mediocre mess.
1820, I've been using MFP for a couple of years now.  I ding it 2 stars only because it's more complicated than it needs to be to delete foods that are in your account (for lack of a better word).  I've got pages of foods I'd love to delete .. should be easy, right?  Nope.  Only one page of foods is provided at a time -- if I delete one food on that page, only one more from the next page will pop up.  What a mess.  I provide 3 stars because this feature irritates me so bad.
1821, Too bad it didn't get picked up for additional seasons.  &#34;Rubicon&#34; had great potential.  It was like &#34;X-Files&#34; but without the aliens and supernatural. The twists and turns this series takes are just enough to keep you intrigued but not enough to give you whiplash (like &#34;The Following&#34; does).  The entire cast are amazing in their roles.  James Badge Dale carries the show without getting in the way of the other actors' performances.  Dallas Roberts is perfect as the comic relief of the team.  The great Miranda Richardson turns in an excellent performance as the tortured widow trying to figure out why her husband committed suicide.  Even Arliss Howard shows that a gay character can be the moral center of a show whose target audience is straight men.  I enjoyed watching &#34;Rubicon&#34; and recommend this series to anyone.
1822, i have thick frizzy red hair, this bottle of jojoba oil has replaced every high end pricy hair product i have ever owned!! (and i've tried them all..) i use it in my hair while still wet & let air dry.  my hair is super silky soft.  cant beat it.  also, in my 3rd trimester of pregnacy i use it on my belly as an anti itch oil.  works great.  definatly reccommend if you have dry skin or hair.  you will find no better oil than this especially at this price :)
1823, At face value, The Disappearance of Alice Creed sounds boring. Only three actors are involved and most of the movie takes place in one room. The story revolves around two guys kidnapping a woman and holding her for ransom. That pretty much sums it up, other than the healthy doses of mini-twists that helps make it a lot more interesting. The three actors are also believable. Gemma Arterton (Quantum of Solace, Clash of the Titans, Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time) is quite convincing as the victim, even though she spends a good amount of time with a ball gag in her mouth. While not gratuitous, the violence is in your face. Overall, this is a well crafted thriller that never quite blooms into something great.
1824, Robinson's novel is great, particularly if you're interested in how a colony on Mars might actually start.  On the other hand, if you are not quite as excited about knowing the science in detail, you may want to consider reading something else.  I was reminded a bit of Moby Dick in some spots: those chapters describing 19th centry whale processing technology in excruciating detail were never my favorites.  You'll get a bit of that here, too. But Robinson usually stops short of the nauseating level of detail.The characters were interesting and multi-faceted.  The shifting narrator perspectives were especially enjoyable.I'm looking forward to reading Green and Blue.
1825, I previously owned the first version of the New Trent external battery. I loved that one and every time I used it always got the "What is that? I Need One" - in fact I ended up buying at least 3 of them for gifts. I bought this when I got a coupon code in the mail and thought I would upgrade. I really love this device - its smaller holds more batter power and also has a cool laser pointer. My only gripe is that it uses a micro USB to charge, so you'll need an adapter or buy a micro usb cord if you lose the included adapter. Highly recommended for anyone who travels and runs out of iPhone power quickly.
1826, The 70's were unarguably the truest point in time for soul music. Motown got a big hit when Marvin Gaye put soul on a new plateau, mainly because he put his entire soul to this golden piece. Throughout his whole career, he tried to find a balance between spirituality and sexuality; on "What's Going On", he found spritual enlightenment in order to tell what has been going on with him, from his brother returning home, changed from the bloodshed of the Vietnam war (a senseless war that took so many innocent lives), living with the hostile realities of America's inner cities, the future of the planet, and his relationship with both his natural father and his spiritual father. This was Marvin Gaye's most monumental accomplishment and took soul music to new levels, and artists such as Curtis Mayfield took it further. Whether you are living good or barely living you should listen to this.
1827, The infant side of this tub wasn't very comfortable for my newborn, she kept slipping and the middle portion that is supposed to keep the baby from slipping is a bit awkward with its triangular shape. It is also a HUGE tub. My mother didn't like it at all and she ended up getting us a very similar smaller version at walmart for 11 dollars, that was much more comfortable and actually fit in our sink. I'll give it another shot when my daughter is about 3 months old and will hopefully have grown into it.
1828, This book is based on an excellent idea that is mostly followed through on. However, it's difficult to like any of the characters. Their mental stability, social standings and interactions and sex lives are studied tediously over and over. Without some of the nonsense this could have been a thoroughly enjoyable book of half the length and I would not have had to skip pages and pages to finish it. By the way - the skipping of long detailed explanations of individual views of the society did not cause a rift in the story.
1829, This soap feels better on my hands that any of the usual store brand I have bought. After using the soap my skin actually feel smoother and healthier than it did before. Sort of like if I put lotion on my hands, but without any residue that lotions normally have. The scent is nice, but not overbearing. The bottle says that the product is an aromatherapy hand soap, but I don't feel the scent is strong enough or last long enough for any sort of mood enhancement or stress relief. Even though the two bottles cost a little more than the store brands, I figure it is worth it. For how much better this soap feels I don't mind my annual hand soap budget going from $10 to $15 dollars.Overall 5 stars for a great product at a great price. I will buy again if the price remains the same.
1830, Mars fans will love this book.  I have to admit that when I first read it I found it difficult to follow all of the characters.  It was Mars itself that kept me going because I loved being there with them.  My second read cleared most of that up for me.  I have managed to get through Blue Mars once but I have not been able to find the energy to go on to Green.The raw red planet is what appealed to me and still appeals to me.  I love visiting it through this novel.
1831, OK, first of all, this was filmed waaaayyy back in 1983 - which means primitive picture quality (for us DVD freaks!!!) and goofy hair & clothes (heh, heh!!!) but hey, it was the 80's!!!. That said, what a concert!!! Being a diehard U2 fan - I have all of their CD's, 2 DVD's, and 2 videotapes..."Under A Blood Red Sky" on VHS...Bono and the lads connected that good with audiences!!! Like I said, despite the picture quality and goofy 80's hair & clothes (good for a few laughs, though!), WOW!!!Here's a full track listing: Surrender, Seconds, Sunday Bloody Sunday, The Electric Co. (unlisted track), October, New Year's Day, I Threw A Brick Through A Window, A Day Without Me, Gloria, Party Girl, 11 O' Clock Tick Tock, I Will Follow, 40...
1832, installed on my kindle fire with no problems. very straight forward to operate. input your city and what you want and hit search. tried to find the number for our post office. gave mailing services in another city. tried usps still gave commercial mailing services in two other cities. our city has two post offices.  do not think  I will keep this due to it's unreliable information.Update. I just deleated this app and installed superpages which not only found my post office but also gave me a map to get there.
1833, First Impressions:-Look a lot better than the other chargers in the market-Comes with a protective storage casePros:-Perfectly sized to fit into the media pockets of laptop bags and also fits perfectly into the palm of your hand-Charged my Droid X twice and put 1/2 charge on my Samsung Admire before needing a recharge-1/2 way charged my Tab 2 while data logging my vehicle and the screen dimmed a bit.-Comes with a LED light and laser pointer.Cons:Literally none that I am able to findOverall:The laser pointer is great for harassing the cat and in a pinch the LED light would be useful.  I own 3 of this guys big brother and keep them everywhere from the waverunner to my camping bag.  This one is the best yet for personal travel as it is not bulky and seamlessly blends in with the rest of the gadgets in the laptop bag.
1834, The second season of London Hospital, extends the essential story line of the first season and does so consistently and with deep emotion. The viewer cannot be unmoved by this show as the characters are finely drawn and the portrayal of the time is exceptional. This show is a learning experience for the viewer as the characters make great medical strides against killers such as burns and scarlet fever. Nurses were always unmarried women who often dedicated their lives to the London, the great hospital of the East End that served the poor of London with precision and decency.Of course, I wish the show had gone on for a third season as I enjoyed it enormously.
1835, I have found the external battery to be amazing and soooo handy! I do construction for a living so have to be able to keep in touch with clients a lot. Many times I have not been able to use my phone when I wanted to for fear of running my battery down when expecting an important call - had to save the charge so my phone would be good when the call came through. This external will enable me to answer all calls and not worrying about missing a business opportunity and still being able to receive the important call!!! This is a great product!!!
1836, with all the 'Should David G have been here or not' aside, this was a very good presentation.  And since I had actually viewed it when it was presented way back when, I was concerned about the presentation of this DVD.  (also curious as to why it took so long) All concerns were settled when I watched it.  I love the performances, and the only one I really didn't care for was Cindy Laupers, but to great relief Joni Mitchell really spooked up the mix and so did S. O'Connor.. . those two gals really grasped the fear and anxiety in the music greatly...And how about the Scorpions with IN THE FLESH.. quite a good job.Last but not least, watching R. Waters sing Goodbye Blue Sky from a hole in the bricks was just great stuff.I really hope Pink Floyd fans get this cd, and Roger Water/David Gilmore fans too... at least the fans can bridge the gap with this excellent product.
1837, Great tool for anyone who is trying to lose weight or gain weight.  Sets calorie goals for the day based on desired outcome.  Searchable database of a wide range of foods or, if you can't find what you want, you can enter information off labels.  Allows you to add exercise, shows how many calories burned and adjusts your daily caloric count to reflect the exercise.  You can add friends and find helpful encouragement and support with private messages or public messages much like facebook.  You can choose to keep whatever information you wish private.  You can connect using facebook but still keep MFP information private from facebook feeds.  Absolutely LOVE this app!
1838, I bought this bluetooth after using another model of Plantronics bluetooth to death. I liked it a lot but it was a little bulky so I went for a slimmer model this time; the Explorer 330. FORGET IT! It won't stay in my ear. It makes my ear so sore that I can hardly force myself to wear it (I have to have it for my job) and if I get four feet away from my cell, I get static. I'm VERY disappointed with this model and will be returning it.
1839, This might have been just another period piece like Bramwell or Ripper Street all of which are fine representations of late 1800's early 1900's London East End. Full of gritty realism and we'll acted it avoids soap opera forms. Not for the weak of stomach.What makes this special is that the unique elements animating the scripts are drawn from diaries of hospital workers of that period and there are historical footnotes supplied at the end of each segment to verify or resolve some of the events shown.  It's Reality TV that is much closer to reality than the staged Reality TV we are normally fed.
1840, App worked when when I first got it.  Now, even after the update it doesn't work properly.  Pace, steps, calories, and distance never calculate properly.  I've tried putting it in my back and front pockets to no avail.  Only time I get any calculation is when I put it in a side pocket on my capris and it's bouncing back and forth.  Voice output doesnt speak anymore, either.  Love the concept and all the features, overall great app...If only it worked properly!  (original Droid)
1841, I have too many cars. And, with the cold winter with too much snow in the north east, my special cars spent months idle in the garage. My friend, owner of several Ferraris, sung the praises of Battery Tender and convinced me to try one on my old BMW. The battery is in the trunk on that car so it's a pain to check. I hooked up the charger using the cigarette lighter attachment and within 18 hours, the little light went green. I jumped in for a quick drive last Friday (our first warm and sunny day) and my old Bimmer started right up. I will get 2 more for the Audi and my aging race car.In today's hyperbolic world, it's refreshing that a product simply does exactly what they claim it will do. And at a price that is quite reasonable.
1842, I picked up the iTorch as a 'just in case' gadget. I am glad I did. The family went camping this weekend and we were out in the middle of no where in a tent. We had cell coverage, but no way to charge iPhones without going back to the car. The IMP52D came worked out perfectly. It was able to recharge an iPhone 4 twice and a Kindle Fire with 1 charge. I cant be totally exact on how long the charges kept because the kids kept plugging their devices into the iTorch, then taking them off 30 minutes later.All in all, buying the iTorch will be the best move you can make if you are looking for a portable external power source for multiple devices!
1843, Some of my family members had this album and I used to listen to it sporadically, liking it more and more with each listen. When I realized that I could not snag one of their copies, I decided to go out and purchase  one of my own. IMO, every song is a classic, but I have narrowed down some  of my favorites, which include : Summer Soft, Joy Inside My Tears, As,  Isn't She Lovely, and Knocks Me Off My Feet. This is an album that will  never lose it's brillance. If you are a true music fan, you should  definitely have this in your collection. I certainly think that it appeals  to those who are fans of every genre of music. That is what makes an album  a masterpiece.
1844, I had many health issues after my pregnancy that helped lead me to being slightly obese. Now a nursing, and busy mom. I found it hard to eat the right calories, nutrients, and fats while losing weight! You shouldn't lose more than 2lbs a week when breastfeeding. Also you need 200-500 extra calories that the baby eats. So I just started by adding 500 calories to my fitness calories and it works great for me. Plus, it tells me how my iron, fats and proteins are for the day (all important for baby). I've been losing 1.9lbs every week. Right in track :)
1845, My friend has lost 12 lbs so far using this app. Told me about it & in less than 2 wks I have lost 4 lbs. My husband just started using it & he likes how easy it is to look up food before he eats. Would definitely recommend to anyone wanting to eat healthier & smarter. If you eat out a lot, you need this app. You'll be surprised at the calories! Way more than you need in a day in just one meal!! Get this app, you'll love it
1846, I have tried my share of lip balms and have a collection of half used sticks that I might as well just throw away since I now plan to only buy Neutrogena's Norwegian Formula lip balm! It feels great when you put it on and the feeling lasts! I like to apply it before I work out and it lasts through a run or other activity where I will breathe through my mouth. Feels good to finally say good-bye to dry, flaky lips :)I also recommend the hand cream by Neutrogena's Norwegian Formula.. it is a great line!
1847, I've been struggling with my weight and wanted to track my calories.  I have never been able to keep a good log of what I eat, since I tend to snack, and don't carry a notebook or something with me.  This is super easy to use, gives me a clear idea of what I have eaten so far and how much I can eat and includes calories burned for exercise.  For some reason, it doesn't count calories for strength exercises, which seems a little odd to me. Even if it's not a lot of calories, it still is something.  I love that I can scan UPC codes - that's been very helpful.I also don't always seem to be able to get to today's entries easily, and I'd like to have access to all the foods I've entered, instead of having to add them again if I had it for dinner last night and lunch today.
1848, I bought these Cargo Pants for my hubby.  He need something with a real pocket to hold his RFID blocking aluminium wallet because it had a habit of slipping out of his regular pant's pocket when he sat down.  Well, these Dickies Cargo Pants sure do the trick!  They came well-packaged in a shipping bag, protecting the package from the weather.  They arrived on time and I received a nice follow up e-mail from Mike, the owner of Elite Hero, the company providing the product for Amazon, making sure everything was up to my expectations and if not, what could he do to fix it.  Great service, nice touch in an all too impersonal world.  Thanks, Mike.  And, thanks Amazon for helping to bring us good companies, like Elite Hero, to do business with on an easy-to-use platform.  Makes my shopping experience a whole lot easier!
1849, I have had the New Trent IMP52D iTorch for about 3 weeks now and I love it.It's a small enough package that it fits in your pocket for charging onthe go. Perfect for the quick charge of your phone when there aren't anyoutlets or USB plugs around. Also the added convenience of a laser pointeris very handy during presentations or product demonstrations. I thoughtthe light was weak but when used in a dark room it works perfectly. I evenuse the iTorch when on the road. The iTorch even kept a full charge after a week of nouse, and topped off my phone in minutes! Great product and the perfectaddition to my road warrior gear.
1850, I feel that the producers had a heavy hand in this season.The colony definitely was not as well organized or focused as the previous season.  The location this season was also a LOT less defensible than the first, but it seemed that they never tried.  I am also thinking that there was a LOT of area that they never looked into, and their hunting and gathering was almost non-existent.If the first season was an example of a healthy and striving colony, then this is an example of an unhealthy colony.
1851, I love science fiction and I was excited they offered a few different books for free for the Kindle. I was interested in finding some new authors to read...I will not be reading this one again.I didn't finish the entire book which is rare for me. I'm an avid reader and I can read quickly- this book was like quicksand. The deeper I got into the book the more I wanted out. I couldn't finish the book b/c it was so freaking boring. I've read a lot of science fiction and am tolerant of very descriptive passages but I kept on thinking this would of been better as a movie rather than a book and that is a first for me. The author gets so completely weighed down in his descriptions- images would of sufficed! Wtf...where was the editor on this one? I really dislike rating a book poorly b/c I realize that enjoying a book is largely subjective but I could not stand this one.
1852, This product is totally amazing.  It allows me to extend the life of my adhesive bra so I get many more wearings than I would have.I don't like bra straps or strapless bras so i use these adhesive cups. After a few wearings the adhesive wears off.  I apply this adhesive to my skin and the cups adhere  without any pulling or stretching of the skin.  It''s also great for  your tops to keep from revealing too much cleavage.  The price  and the product is great.  I will certainly be purchasing more when I need it.
1853, I use these to pump into and then to store the milk in the fridge. If I'm pumping to freeze, then I store in the Dr. Brown's bags. Glass bottles are fantastic- they're the absolute best for preserving your milk, easy to boil and sanitize, great price, and they can go in the dishwasher. I would definitely have directly bottle fed my daughter with these, but she absolutely refused any bottle, that didn't look and feel more like mama. However, my best friend has EBF three babies for a year and all three took to this bottle no problem, when she returned to work each time. So, I'm hoping that when my daughter's older she may take to them (she's only 3 months) but in the meantime, I use the lansino moMMa bottles for feeding, and she has no issues with those. Also, if you've ever had coca cola in a glass bottle versus coca cola in a plastic bottle, you can definitely appreciate how glass preserves the flavor- ijs
1854, I used these NGK to replace Champion spark plugs and overall a much better spark plug. The Champion plugs looked very poorly made with an electrode that looked like it was cut with a cheap cutter while the NGK looked very good. The NGK spark plugs look very high quality and are reasonably priced considering they are Iridium. I have used NGK spark plugs in everything from race engines to marine engines to lawnmowers and have never had a problem. While you may pay more than a cheaply made spark plug, you will get better starting, better performance and much longer spark plug life.
1855, Songs in the Key of Life is supreme. He really outdid himself on this one, with songs like Village Ghetto Land, I Wish, Sir Duke, and one of my personal favorites not released as a single, Joy Inside my Tears, this man cemented his position as one of the great musical genius of our time. I really can't put into words how good Stevie's music makes me feel. I listen to him when I need a pick-me-up or just want to jam or feel good. This album though, deserves it's title because it does cover every aspect of life, the black experience and for everyone. I think the song Ngiculela is fantastic. His vocals as usual are so clear and towards the end when he carries his voice saying &quot;I am singingggggggggggggggg........&quot; gives me goosebumps everytime I hear it. So emotionally intense and open. He's fabulous. Socially conscious, deep and personal. SITKOL is his greatest work.
1856, I am a fan of British comedies & Dawn/Saunders productions. This cast includes too many big name English actresses to count. BUT: it was too annoying to continue watching past a few minutes.  I couldn't believe it, there were several of my favorite English actresses assembled with a potentially clever premise & they were irritating the heck out of me. I can appreciate the desire to capitalize on the small English village eccentrics angle but not to the point of being gross or making fun of physical or mental disabilities. Maybe it's my own Texan sensitivities. I'll just rewatch &#34;Calendar Girls&#34; for this genre.
1857, I like this app. I had very little trouble setting it up (had to try multiple user names). It has a huge database of food (although some of the counts are wrong so you do need to check against the package.). I'm able to add my own recipes which is nice since i make a lot of homemade items. It does sometimes require you to add the calories you burned exercising if it is not on their list of exercises. Overall I think this is a good app.
1858, My husband likes this product and has been using it for years. The reason I gave it four stars is because the online usage instructions refer to this product as foam, which my husband greatly prefers, but this came in liquid, non-foaming form, so he is disappointed. The liquid tends to run, while the foam stays put.  It would have been nice, if the instructions had not been misleading and I'm sure others would appreciate if the seller would correct this . Otherwise, it is a good product.
1859, Songs in The Key of Life may be considered Stevie Wonder's epic,but this overblown collection has more fat than meat,especially the second half.Fortunately its been remastered and reissued with newly improved liner  notes and sound.The first CD pressing sounds as if its been mastered from a  4th generation master.Now the sound is cleaner as well as clearer.Its a  whole new listening experience that even the dull songs(Joy Inside My  Tears,Black Man)are worth a second listen.Although the classics(I Wish,Sir  Duke,As,Isn't She Lovely)appear on At The Close Of The Century,its nice to  hear them in their original album context(especially the underrated gem  Summer Soft).Granted this would've made a better single album,but the  digital makeover makes it sounds like  the first time you've heard it back  in '76.
1860, Very disappointed in this soap.  The scent is not "lemony"...it stinks of "old lady powdered perfume".  If you know what I mean by an old powdered scent...you'll know what I mean.  You get this on your hands and you will have to smell it for hours.  It's horrible raising food to your mouth with this "perfume" on your hands.  You can't wash it off either.Besides that, after washing a few cups during the day, I noticed my hands were now chapped and burning.  The detergents in this soap opened the cuticle of my skin on my hands so horribly that they felt like someone had taken sandpaper to them.Absolutely horrible stuff.  Oh, your dishes will smell of this perfume too.  I raised a cup to my mouth to drink coffee and smelled the powdery perfume smell in the cup.  Had to rinse and rinse and rinse.  Never buy again.
1861, i watched this because the director is behind the new Godzilla movie. This movie has a lot going for it: nice directing, it's beautifully filmed, great cinematography, creative settings/backgrounds, excellent use of the aliens  - goes to show that 100+ million dollars is not necessary. BUT, it just plods along. it is not about smash and destroy aliens - they serve as the push for the interactions of the 2 lead characters and that is fine - i had no trouble with that. what i did have trouble with was it moved so slowly with little if any character development - i never really learned anything more about these people. and 80 minutes into it i just didnt care, then poof 5 minutes of intrigue and THE END. as a prime member, try it, but don;t pay for it.
1862, 5 for the cover, which is incredibly haunting, and probably one of the best covers ever, and then 5 for the music.  this ep is amazing, taking you from under the sea to the furthest star and back in only 2 songs.  it's all instrumental, except for the shouting of &quot;1, 2, 3!&quot; before the rocking breakdown at the end of track 2.  i don't know what else to say, because there is no way you can describe this in words.  buy it.
1863, Haven is a strong show - 13 episodes set in Haven, Maine.Quickly, you learn that this town isn't normal at all.  The show does a good job of peeling the layers back slowly.  The writers say they have 7 seasons of mythology, and at 13 episodes a season, I would believe.If you like TV that makes you think, this is an excellent show to pick up.  The special features are pretty interesting - the writers talk about Season 2, which sounds great.  They also point out that they do put in a ton of clues in each episode, that do build on each other.The season ending is certainly different.  Be warned, their are characters that will die that you probably like quite a bit.The main 3 characters are pretty strong, but my favorites are the two brothers who run the newspaper.  I would love an episode set in the past featuring more on them.
1864, Wanted to change the fuel filter out and only use ACDelco on the truck when I can grab one. The install of this filter is easy but be forewarned, you will get some gas on you so be sure to use gloves and something to catch anything that spills from the fuel lines. Install usually takes less than 30 minutes and be sure to use FUEL/BRAKE line wrenches on this because you can easily round off the fuel line fittings. Thanks Amazon for carrying ACDelco, it helps me avoid picking these up from the dealership.
1865, Bob Marley and the Wailers / at the Rainbow (2 DVD set): This is a Great DVD of Bob Marley in concert and here you can see just how powerful and charismatic a personality he was.  All the songs here are great and are a kind of `greatest hits' package all on its own.  The second DVD has the "Caribbean Nights" documentary about Marley and it is very good but probably won't be played more than a couple of times.  This concert, this DVD, earns a solid Five Star rating.
1866, After taking some time to find the right fit, (this is the hardest part)I now cannot wait to put these back on. The sound is crisp, I am a old time rock & roller, like my music good & loud. This headset does the trick.Take the time to adjust. I read a few of the reviews that said hard to fit. I disagree. Even in the instructions, they recommend adjusting to get the perfect fit. Believe me, you will know when you do.I would buy again.
1867, I have Tweetcaster, Hootsuite &amp; the so-called Twitter app (the last actually being little more than a bookmarks to launch the browser &amp; take you to the twitter site on the web) on my Kindle Fire. Of the three, Tweetcaster works best &amp; is the one I use most often. Unlike Hootsuite, it does not offer to post directly to LinkedIn, but it does direct post to Twitter or Facebook or both. It is hard to describe why, but this app just functions better than the others named. If you tweet, get it!
1868, John Kelly's wife is killed in an automobile accident. The book begins by describing his dealing with the loss of his wife. John befriends a former prostitute who is on the run from the cities leader in organized crime.  Kelly then falls in love with Pam, a prostitute, who has escaped from her pimp, who works for an up and coming drug lord. John Kelly is an ex-navy SEAL.  The pimp/drug lord has a hit done on Kelly and kidnaps Pam. Though Kelly is left for dead, he is taken to the hospital and recovers. In the meantime, Pam is brutally tortured and murdered.This triggers John Kelly's vengeful attitude. He takes it upon himself to seek justice be tracking down and trying to kill every member of the offending organization.What a brilliant  fast pace book.  I highly recommend it.  I also loved HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER by Tom Clancy.
1869, I can't understand what Amazon is doing with these filters.  I've gotten them for under $5 and then a week later they're almost $8.  Crazy.  Regardless, it's a good filter and if the little gel thing really works you're pretty much good to go.  It's a question of buying this filter or the high mileage oil with the additives package--you have to find out how to do things more cheaply.  Considering this filter is $3 to $4 more than the regular old Fram, and high mileage oil is $3 to $4 more than the regular oil, you need to wait and see what goes on sale.I do like the Fram rough finish on the cap.  Makes it sooooooo much easier to get the filter off.
1870, I own five or six Bob Marley dvds, and they all have shoddy audio and video workmanship...which really takes away from the excellent performances. This video is absolutely top notch; the audio and video qualities are excellent, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who appreciates reggae music. This video looks as if it was produced a couple of years ago, and that's saying a lot - when you consider how old this performance is. This is one of my favorite videos, and it's a mainstay in my weekend rotation. Buy this one...you will truly be impressed.
1871, I have to agree with one of the reviewers about the printing on the leather diamond piece.  The picture of the product (on Amazon) shows this blank.  This isn't a problem for me, all it reads is the company's name and it isn't tacky.  And the other issue about the shades of red being different didn't apply to me.  My suspenders are the same shade of red.  The suspenders are made well with strong canvas type material for over the shoulder and the elastic pieces are attached to the back.  I think they're great and will order another.
1872, I have an average sized mattress and this fits perfectly!  It is super easy to install!  If it &quot;bunches up&quot; like some others suggest, it is because it isn't put on the mattress correctly.  A little tug, and it goes right in place... kind of like a normal bed sheet, know what I mean?After washing, many lint balls pile up, but it is durable in the fact that it isn't falling apart!  Just because it collects lint balls doesn't make it any less durable in my honest opinion.I recommend at least two of these!
1873, I love this semi-sheer feminine gown with it's lovely details.  It's comfortable and elegant.  But it is too sheer to wear in front of anyone other than your husband or boyfriend.  Miss Elaine is now one of my favorite nightgown designers because they have products that are very frilly, flirty and feminine.  I ordered the large and it is a bit long for me, I'm 5 foot 4.  Other than that it fits fine and a medium would have been fine too.  sb
1874, We have a pretty wide door frame. About 32&#34;. This works well in the space.Cons: The foot pedal length will prevent you from closing the door. If it were shorter, I could still close the door and leave the gate up.It takes quite a bit of force to open it with the foot pedal. It makes a pretty loud sound when doing so, and so quietly  checking in on the baby is a challenge.It's not really hands free because as you enter, the gate swings very fast and so whatever is on the other side, like, the door, is going to get banged. Plus you need to use your hand to close it back or else your cat is going to take the opportunity to run in.
1875, Tired of having to turn on my computer to recharge my iPod, I decided to check Amazon for a charger instead of buying it at a local retailer. Boy am I glad I did - a charger, car adapter, and retractable USB all for less then $10 including shipping. I use the retractable USB charger when synching my iPod since my dogs tend to come investigate whatever I am doing and get tangled in the cord. Not so with the retractable one.I got a second set for my office/travel so that I can recharge for the ride on my long commute home. It is a definite must have for iPod users.
1876, I appreciate that it comes with a full array of battery-ends (4 each of alligator clips and screw-attached).  The simple lights means I can &#34;read&#34; it from across the room...Only 4 stars, though, because it's *not possible* to get 4 cars close enough to this thing to use it as is.  Either you need to pull the batteries out (annoying) or buy a pile of the 25' extension cables (what I did) to reach over to the cars.I'd think, at this price, throwing in at least a couple extension cords would not be unreasonable (heck, even increase the price to include them...who wouldn't use them?)
1877, Been using for about a week,  very good features ...has had every brand of food, even from Aldi. Took off one star because I am sure the exercise calories are much overstated.  For my height and weight,  I don't burn 420 calories going for a 45 minute walk. That sure would be nice!  That is the only concern.  I love using the app on my smartphone,  it makes me stop and think before mindlessly eating something just because it's there. I find it a game that I want to win every day by ending up with a few calories left and not going over.
1878, this is a bare bones baby monitor, but it does what it's supposed to do. we get strong reception throughout our 3 level house with ceramic tile floors and thick walls.  we can hear even very quiet things like our girl's soft snoring and the rustling of sheets.  i have no need for a super fancy monitor -- i just want to know if the baby is asleep or awake and needs tending to.  this monitor is all i need for that.we've been using this monitor for about 6 months now and have had no problems with it. i was a bit hestitant to order when i saw how many people had problems with the product, but thought it was worth a shot.
1879, The reviewer who thinks that the Lighthouse Family (of whom the lead singer marked Gaye as an influnce)is better than this doesn't know what he's talking about.He should stick to his Shakin Stevens and other rubbish like that.Back to this which has been a favorite of mine since 1987 and to say that they don't make music like this anymore is becoming an understatment.This is solid gold soul music worth anything than the likes of 50 Cent.I won't go to detail of this as the other 5 star reviews have done so.Except to say that many of the tracks have been covered by many artists over the years.It's one of the last great Motown recordings to come out of Detriot through their golden years (1963-1971).It's a still an all time classic 34 years on that brings out the best of Gaye,the Funk Brothers and especially one of the worlds greatest bass players, the late great James Jamerson.
1880, The Silk Vendetta is one of Victoria Holt's best books. Mixing intrigue, mystery, romance and suspense, she weaves a compelling tale round the heroine Lenore, who grows up at The Silk House. The background of the silk trade is engrossing, and Lenore's character is compelling as she deals with the two men in her life, Philip - likeable and kindhearted- and Charles, as cruel as he is handsome. But as always with Victoria Holt, all is not as it seems, and Lenore has to go through a succession of adventures before finding true love. If you like your romances sevred up with plenty of adventure, then read this book. If you've read other Victoria Holt books then you'll know what I mean, and if you haven't, you're in for a treat.
1881, We often tow our a-frame travel trailer which is near the tow rating of our Grand Vitara. A hot day with a strong headwind proved to be too much for the factory cooling system &#60;a pipe through the radiator&#62; and the transmission fluid got too hot and bubbled over.I had been debating getting a cooler thinking &#34;Why would I need one if it is rated  for this work from the factory&#34;. If you don't have an external cooler and will be towing near your maximum, just do it and forget about it!  For the do-it-yourself installer, the hardest part is mounting it.
1882, I'm such a huge Michael fan, I love everything he does. Moonwalker is so  good, I loved every minute of it, I have watched it so many times. I Cannot  wait until his new movie comes out next year, He's going to be portraying  Edgar Allen Poe. Believe me I'll be the first in line to watch it. Michael  is a genius, there is no other male singer that can come close to Michael.  He is the true King. I'll always be a Michael Jackson Fan, I'm not ashamed  to say that.
1883, Though to some extent the Fall are a "single's band" they still have put out a lot of solid albums. Owning all of them might bankrupt you so besides any of their greatest hits albums (as long as they focus on older material) this is the place to start. This Nation's Saving Grace sounds like a monologue on everything from Margaret Thatcher era England (Spoilt Victorian Child)to the leader of one of the group's greatest influences, Can (I am Damo Suzuki) over angular post punk/funk rhythms.  I prefer it over Gang of Four as This Nation's Saving Grace is not guilty of being didactic but instead is a chunk of bile and vitriol that must have been on Steve Albini's turntable more than once. I don't know whether the current bunch of post punkers from Williamsburg that slavishly imitate this sound are a good or bad thing. However, the Fall, despite line up changes are still a solid band and This Nation's Saving Grace is their most focused musical statement.
1884, I get that this is the size that it is so it can be set inside of a sink, but who does that anyway??!!  It's designed to be set on the counter and allow the water to drain into the sink - they would have made this much more functional had they made it twice the length so it could accommodate more dishes.  A nice effort by Camco, but overall disappointed at the missed opportunity.It does have a notch in the drain tray that goes over raised beveled sink edges, so that's pretty useful.
1885, This is a great DVD but be warned it is in PAL format and doesn't play in many DVD payers in USA.  It would not play in my BluRay players (3 of them) but did play in a simple and inexpensive Phillips which we bought to use with low resolution movies.  So be sure you can pay PAL.Once we solved the hardware issue the DVD played beautifully.  The songs are great and it has Trouble Man by Waylon which I had not seen performed.  He was great.  All of the Highway Men were good.  Too bad this concert is not out  in NTSF so the USA can easily play it.
1886, Hands down BEST BATH EVER. This bathtub is awesome. We originally purchased a different tub, but at 4 months our baby outgrew that one so we opted to buy the PRI EuroBath. I only wish we'd bought this tub first. It is big, but its not any more cumbersome than a smaller tub. Our little man has plenty of room to splash around and he can rest comfortably in it with all of his bath toys. It is super easy to clean and a great great product. Don't bother buying the smaller tubs, go with this one!!
1887, I have the driest skin... plus I live in the south and get too much sun.  I started using this lotion at the suggestion of my daughter who insisted that the colloidal oatmeal was the key for her skin.  So, I found Aveeno's version and LOVE this stuff!  My skin absorbs it like no other lotion and it helps keep it smooth and soft.  I'm 59 yrs. old and never expected to have this happen at this point.  I get this every two months from Amazon and love it much better than the over-perfumed lotions at Bath & Body and shops like that, plus it's a better deal.
1888, It is 1980 the 70's is finally over but as we enter a new Decade An Icon by the name of Stevie Wonder Drops his Last Great album in his Legendary Career and what a great Album this is Riding off all the Benefits from his previous Album (Songs In The Key Of Life) this may not be on the same level as Songs... But what a Valiant Effort he put forth here is some of my Favorite Tracks "Master Blaster Jammin" "Lately" "All I Do" Rocket Love" "Happy Birthday" Etc... Those are some of the favorites of mine off the album but the only song I didn't like was the terrible "I Ain't Gonna Stand For It" but other than that this is his best album in the 80's phase of his Legacy.
1889, I've watched David Suchet as Hericule Poirot from the beginning; and the later versions have a different flavor then those first broadcast on PBS. I wasn't disappointed; as Suchet's performances are sublime, simply the best. One does miss Miss Lemon, Hastings and Japp, but the more things change; the more Poirot stays the same. If you are a fan of the series, I don't believe you will be disappointed in the offerings of Series 11. The downloading was a snap; and it's a treat to be able to watch without the Internet.
1890, This is the Tom Clancy before the horrible Red Rabbit and the long and also horrible the bear and the Dragon. What I mean is that this is Tom Clancy at his best. This is my fav Clancy novel. It is about John Kelly whose wife has just died, and months meets a woman who he finds out had a terrible past. He tries to help her but then she dies also and Kelly sets out to punish the men who did that to her. Meanwhile there are American soldiers trapped in a Vietnamese camp and the American Government wants Kelly to help them rescue them. It is an action packed novel. If you like Tom Clancy novels, this is one novel you must not miss. To my opinion this is Clancy's best novel.
1891, I love this app!  It's so easy to use and I love that you don't have to be online to use it (I'm on a Kindle Fire HD).  This was recommended by both my doctor and nutritionist and I'm glad I listened to them.  I've been much more successful with this program than anything else I've tried.  Having an easy way to keep track of what I eat and having a constant support system of people who have the same goals as I do have been the keys to my success. I definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to get healthy.
1892, Kim Stanley Robinson's RED MARS is a monumental work, the beginning of a three book trilogy spanning well over 1,500 pages. Robinson manages to elaborate on points from the most mundane issues of gossip, affairs, and body image; to...well the colonization of Mars. RED MARS is an important work, and I think well grounded, on the relationship between human beings and their place of dwelling. Mars is a living creature here, and mankind manages to twist it in every way from our ideas, objectification, and the inevitable destruction at the hand of these conflicting views.This book is a must for any fan of hard science-fiction. A passionate, researched, and thorough account of the theoretical colonization of Mars...with the occasional lull of thirty to forty pages of terrain under its scientific name, under scientific terms.
1893, Red Mars is like nothing I have read.  It's a story of the first hundred people to colonize Mars.  The plot is a bit predictable, but interesting nonetheless, and a sort of mystery develops early on in the book.  Set in a world described in excruciating detail, I was awed by how scientifically accurate this book was, making it very believable. I'm normally not a fan of political struggles, but Kim Stanley Robinson has made the political struggles of the Red Planet worth reading about, and very intriguing. I would not call this a traditional sf work.  This is beyond FICTION....it could easily be our future; a some-day history book.
1894, I absolutely love this gate.  We were going to get two, but only got one to make sure we'd like it.  We didn't want to drill any holes and our gate sits at the bottom of the stairs just like in the pictures, only on the floor not the first step.  It's great.  All four points where the gate touches the wall are different depth and I also used the extension kit and it works perfectly.  It is very stable and my little boy can't open it or pull it down. I'm about to order another one for the top of the stairs.
1895, Basically it's an album of contrasts.  On the first disc Tupac displays his talent brilliantly and flawlessly.  The beats are infectious and the science he drops is noteworthy.However the second disc is, on the whole,  quite sub par and typical of so much of the rap being put out by the 90's  era of rappers.  Musically boring and lyrically/creatively run of the  mill.Personally I felt that Tupac was on the road to megastardom both as  a rapper and as an actor.  Both fields in which he had tremendous talent  and perhaps even more potential.Nonetheless, this album is definitely  well worth a purchase just don't expect very much from Disc 2.
1896, This watch is close to perfect, I have one for daily wear and the "rubber" band version for exercise.  I prefer analog, and the bonus is the large digital date, easy to read dual alarms and countdown timer.  I use them all regularly, though I normally leave the date display off. The 42 lap timer is also magnificently readable, I just don't need it much.This watch is so much better than those tiny six point type digital displays hidden in the face of a typical analog watch. I NEED to use the date and I can't see those small ones without glasses.My only criticism, and it's minor, is that the watch is notably heavy.
1897, I love this diaper depot.  Prior to purchase, I thought it might be a little cheap, but it's the exact opposite.  It is well made with hard thick plastic.  It holds the diaper warmer on top and the side bins are great for nic-nacs like diaper cream, nail clippers, brush, etc.  It stores the diapers in the middle and has slots at the bottom where you can pull the diaper out from the left side or the middle of the depot.  It frees up so much space from the changing table and keeps everything organized and accessible.  We have a Graco Sarah changing table and it fits perfectly on the front.  This was one of the best baby items we bought along with the Prince Lionheart premium diaper warmer.
1898, Harry Flashman, Victorian England's unlikely hero, the unknown &quot;ace of cads,&quot; is up to his old tricks.  He travels to the American west with a traveling bordello, goes on a scalp-hunting party, marries an Apache chief's daughter and rides out with Kit Carson in '49.  Then it's back to the West in '79 so he can attend the massacre at Little Bighorn and almost be scalped by Frank Standing Bear, who turns out to have a very reasonable grudge against our anti-hero.  Whew!  As always, Fraser is a raconteur of humor and wit and a historian of astonishing erudition.  His depth of research is commendable, and would be even if he didn't use it to make every nuance of historical events more human and understandable.  This book, while light reading, is hilarious and instructive: it's a  towering achievement.
1899, I am not getting up there in years yet, but there is nothing wrong with someone in their 20s protecting their skin- it is called taking proactive measures.  I love this stuff- I started using this stuff four years ago and I was sold from the very first use.  It goes on nice and easy and spreads over your skin.  It doesn't feel oily once it is spread on your skin and leaves your face feeling firm and soft.  My skin tends to get a little red when I spread it on, but that quickly disappears after a minute or two.  I love the way this stuff makes my skin feel!I have noticed that they now make a version of this serum that has no fragrance, but I actually prefer the fragrance!Definitely a five star product that I highly recommended.  I gave my mom some of this when she was out visiting, and she loves it too!  It is a must have for your skin care regimen!
1900, Without Remorse is Clancy's introduction to John Clark, a character who  reappears in many other novels (Clear and Present Danger, Cardinal of the  Kremlin, etc.).  Clark, formerly John Kelley, is involved in two different  plots in this book, in completely different settings but nicely parrelel.  There are no plot holes in this book, and some moments where you just stop  reading because you are so suprised by what you read.This book is also  the &quot;death&quot; of Kelley.  On his mission of revenge he loses his  humanity, and this death explains some of his other evil actions, as in the  finale to Rainbox Six.
1901, This film has to be one of the most underrated films. First of all, a lot of people said there's no point or plot to this movie, but who cares.... ITS THE BEATLES!!! I think its a cool time piece. This came from the same psychedlic minds of John, Paul, George, and Ringo that brought you "Sgt. Pepper". It has beautiful scenery and color. And the scene where John is shoveling the spaghetti onto Ringo's Aunt's plate is just awesome. It was an actual dream that John had and it came true. Who wouldn't like to go on a Magical Mystery Tour with the Beatles???
1902, I bought this necklace for a pendant I also purchased on Amazon.  It is very shiny and made of quality silver.  Definitely an eye-catcher!HOWEVER, it is not nearly as thick as it appears in the picture.  Which is my fault for not paying attention to the '2mm' on the title!My warning is this: if you're a guy, this necklace is probably a bit too thin to fit your masculinity.And that is entirely based on my personal opinion.  If thin rope necklace is your fad, and you're a man, so be it.Although I bought this chain for myself, since it wasn't thick enough I was able to use it for a pendant I bought my wife. It looks absolutely beautiful on her!
1903, I can't give these less than 3 stars. After watching my strong, young husband reduced to a stooped near-invalid by whiplash after he fell on black ice, I'm a believer in ice cleats. They don't look terribly chic, but neither does an arm cast. They lose 2 points, though, because while his stay on his big Timberland boots, mine don't stay on my slightly-more-ladylike waterproof boots. They're the right size and all, but my boots don't have a "ledge" where the sole meets the boot, and the Yaktrax have an annoying habit of popping off in the middle of the sidewalk. Many's the time I've backtracked for a Yaktrax, retracing my steps amidst the snow-narrowed sidewalks of Brooklyn to find the lost cleat. Are you one of the unlucky ones whose shoes won't hold these on? You'll never know until you buy them. And that's why I can't give them more than three stars.
1904, Nice and sturdy! Easy to install and use. It has hands-free opening so its good when you have your hands full like I always do. This gate wont budge when it is installed so it is very safe. It looks nicer then some of the other gates on the market.We still have this years later and got a second one when we moved. My oldest is almost 4 and she still cant open it on her own. She isn't heavy enough for the peddle. Still loving it!
1905, I purchased these because the regular nipples on my wide-neck Dr. Brown bottles have too fast of a flow for my 3 week old (side note: these fit the Dr. Brown's wide-neck bottles perfectly). These Avent #1 nipples have the same problem: they are just too darn fast. My son choked on the milk from his bottle when we used these because the milk was pouring into his mouth. I see that some other reviewers with newborns have loved this nipple.  I guess every infant's needs are different.
1906, Do not waste your time with this one!  I saw this concert live back in the day and was very excited when I saw it on DVD. However, whoever the idiot was that destroyed what could have been a great show with a wave after wave of crowd shots, freeze frames, and silly cartoonish effects should be never be allowed to mix another DVD.  Many reviews are correct, the show is great, sound good, and I am a huge Police fan, but take it from a huge concert fan.  When the camera is on the band, which isnt often, they have head shots mostly, and rarely show anyone but sting.  The effects are so silly that "every breath" is entirely in black and white and much of it slow motion, stings face only???Matt D Knoxville
1907, I just bought this on CD as it was on sale through the CD club.  I have the original vinyl, but hadn't listened to it in years.This is one of the best works of music ever conceived, written and performed.  It is absolutely timeless and each song impresses you more than the last.  Put this one on repeat and let it play three or four times. It just keeps getting better.Stevie is an awesome talent and this may be his best.  Don't forget how great music was in the 70's.  This work is one of the major reasons for the resurgence of 70's music today by artists that weren't even born then.  You can see quite clearly the artists that followed Stevie.  Most recently Alicia Keys who would be the first to say his music is pure inspiration.
1908, Not so much a sequel to Storm of Swords.  Provides narratives not found in the Storm of Swords in the same time period.  ex: Tyrion,  Arya, Daenerys  Actually...in hind sight, it was a great idea putting these in a book after the fourth as I seriously could have cared less about many of the characters featured in book 4.  Sansa?  Pfft.  Cercei? &#34;hey, i'm queen incestuous bitch.&#34;  Sam was mildly entertaining if it wasn't for his 24/7 bitching and moaning.  But Jon Snow, Arya, Tyrion, and Daenerys?  Hell yeah!
1909, Though Amazon stated this cap would not fit my 2013 Ford E-450 chassis (for a Jayco, Class C, Greyhawk, RV), I ordered it anyway as it fits many other years of Ford trucks and looks the same. It is rare for the same vehcle to change a design like that. It, in fact, fits perfectly. Our RV gas filler has no cover (not that that is a deterrant) and 60 gallons is a target for remote theft of gas, or a target for vandalism. This cap fits well. I have not been able to fit the stock cap-retainer onto it yet. I understand these modern vehicles have anti siphon plugs but one can still end up with foreign substances in the exposed fill-tube. This is a good 'ounce of prevention'.Highly recommended.
1910, I ordered this fan to replace a model 4000 fan in my trailer.  The 5000 allows me to have air moving both in AND out.  Our fan is located over the bed so it feels like a ceiling fan when we have it blowing in at night.  We live in the Desert Southwest and like to have air moving over us at night as we sleep.  This fan requires a special model for the screw-less mounting on the roof.  After I returned the first 5000 (because it had 12 screws that go into the roof), I received the special mounting model that doesn't require screws to be used on the roof - just four screws that secure the fan from the inside.  This fan, with the Ultra Breeze Vent Cover, will move a lot of air and allow for some terrific circulation.
1911, I find that I have to change the foam every few weeks in order to maintain fit and achieve maximum quality.  The sound quality is amazing, except for the lows.  As others have mentioned, the bass is lacking in this pair.  I originally had a pair of Shure e3c which I found to be overall better than these.  Even the Shure case was better.  I wanted to try these out because of all the raving reviews.  While they are very good earphones, the Shure's may be better.
1912, These, and ALL Dickies brand work pants would be perfect if it weren't for the following:1.) They are stiff as cardboard. Incredibly uncomfortable until you wash them several dozen times or wear them in. If you wear them for the first time and it's hot outside, they are stuffy, itchy and you sweat like a pig in them.2.) A button really needs to be what holds the pants closed, not a clip. When you kneel down to do something, it pops open, which allows the zipper to come undone. Not cool.3.) Waist rides too high and is so tight that if you tuck in a Dickies shirt (which some places require) you won't be able to close the pants. The shirts are a whole different story...... they suck too.
1913, This is just the perfect fit for my 2001 Honda Accord - passenger side. I bought a pair along with the driver side wiper that is 5 inch longer. Replacing is a cinch (I mean if you have already replaced a wiper before, all it takes is 30 seconds).My old one is steel framed "Rain X", it is broken now. Part of the rubber squeegee is peeling like a piece of string cheese hanging down. Not to discredit it, but it lasted also a couple of years and I have no problem getting the same product except I wanted to try something else. The Bosch 4819 is sleeker looking. Very lightweight and works perfect with no streaks. Very happy with it - I just have to see how long it will last through summer and winter seasons in Virginia weather.
1914, I purchased one of these back in 2003 (for our dog).  Now I wanted another pressure-mounted, hands-free gate for our toddler and this is the product I immediately thought of purchasing.I was extremely disappointed when I received the gate and realized that there is no longer a ramp to help prevent tripping over the lower bar.  I thought that feature was one of the main advantages of the older gate version.  Why would the manufacturer discontinue that?  Surely it would not cost a lot more to include that piece, and I think parents would be willing to pay a few extra dollars for added safety.Fortunately I was able to find another product that solved the problem for me:Tee-Zed Dreambaby No-Trip Gate Ramp, WhiteIt's not as perfect a fit as the original ramp, but it still works very well.  Kudos to Dreambaby for thinking of selling such a product.  I wish The First Years product manager would reconsider including the ramp with this gate.
1915, Having been born in 1962, I wasn't able to witness the hysteria that surrounded the Beatles' 1st trip to America; until now. This video puts you right in the middle of everything they experienced (well, almost) on their  February, 1964 trip. Their arrival, and press conference, at Idlewild  Airport, taxi rides, photo shoots, after hours parties and all 3 Ed  Sullivan Show appearances in their entirety. Also included are 3 songs from  the Washington Coliseum concert. After watching this video, it's easy to  understand why Americans were captivated by these guys. It's also very  apparent why the Beatles could only tolerate this &quot;mania&quot; for 2  more years. I wish I could have experienced it firsthand.
1916, I'm on track to lose 20 lbs thanks to this fantastic app! Once you enter your basic information and weight goal, it sets a caloric intake goal for you that is easy to follow. The food database is amazing.. I've only had to enter the nutritional info of one food so far, and everything else shows up by entering the description in the search bar. In addition to the number of calories, it also displays all the nutritional info of all the food that you've eaten that day. It really has made this whole process a lot easier, and I can't wait to finally meet my goal!
1917, I bought this daily moisturizer along with the eye serum, face serum and and night cream.  I generally use Loreal daily moisturizer but figured I'd try all of the Olay Regenerist products.  The first thing I noticed is that Olay is thicker than Loreal.  The second thing is the fragrance.  Loreal has a nice, light lemony scent.  Olay's scent is much stronger and floral.  I've only been using it for about a week so I can't really judge the effects.  However, I am a little turned off by the scent.Update:  I've gotten used to the thickness and scent.  I think I still prefer the Loreal but this is a good everyday moisturizer.  I've definitely noticed an improvement in my skin since using the Regenerist line.
1918, This is a collection of short stories including some featuring Hercule Poirot, a Parker Pyne story and some Mr Satterthwaite and Harley Quinn stories as well as a couple which don't feature any of the author's regular detectives.  I particularly enjoyed the Harley Quinn stories as they always have that extra dimension as well as being mysteries.I particularly enjoyed the last story in the collection `Magnolia Blossom' which caused me to reach for the tissues.  It certainly shows human nature in the worst possible light.  Apart from that one I also enjoyed `The Harlequin Tea Set' and `The Love Detectives'.  This is an interesting collection and could be a good introduction to Agatha Christie's writing for someone who hasn't read anything by her before.
1919, This CD you can listen too now,and fall in love with it.  The words to 'Irons in the Fire', can you feel what she is saying? "Tune in Tomorrow" -What do we do now, now that we both know how?  This is was ture R&B music is!  I can see how this album went on the sell millions years after it was released!  I can only say if you do not feel this CD, you do not know music, no matter how old you are,, Pick it up!  Oh yea Alica Keys had to be listing to this cd when she started writing songs.
1920, It would appear that there's no room for any more sci-fi on television! Really. "V" and "The Event" are gone. All that's left now is "Fringe" and now "Falling Skies"! Falling Skies may not even get a second season let alone a complete first season. We'll see. Same for the comming "Battlestar Galactica: Blood & Chrome".Sci-fi is going the way of veriety shows(extinction) and soon no network will even bother putting out a science fiction product. Not unless we pay for it "directly"!
1921, The unit works boosting weak cell phone signals.If you are in a area with a fairly strong signal, the data rate seemed to be slower when using the booster. I would attribute this to the inherent signal delay introduced by the booster - which probably does not affect voice calls, so don't expect higher data rates when using the booster with a data card. On the other hand, when using a data card where the external signal is VERY weak, the data card was unable to keep a reliable data connection, but the signal was still usable for a voice connection.
1922, Holy cow! If George Martin had written the Wizard of oz Scarecrow would have been burned, the lion butchered, the tin man melted down for scrap and when Dorothy finally got home, Auntie Em would be dead on the floor.  BUT I love the story -certainly not predictable - intricate interwoven plot lines, fantastic and real characters --none perfect --some far too real --so real their deaths in the story left me grieving-- and rushing to download the next in the series---surely at least one of my Stark family will survive---Winter is here!
1923, This is the 10th Timex Ironman watch I've purchased since 1987, and it will be my very last.  Timex has begun using "chi chi" watch bands.  Well, my wife looked down at her christmas present after only 4 months, and the watch WAS GONE FROM THE BAND!  What a piece of garbage, I'm out $35 !!If you use Timex Ironman watches, you know that the plastic bands eventually fail.  What are you going to do when this band fails?  NOTHING AT ALL, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO THROW IT AWAY !!!I'd rather own a happy meal than this watch.  From now on, I'm going to buy the Ladies Expedition model, which uses standard watch bands.  TIMEX THIS IS MY LAST IRON MAN PURCHASE !!!
1924, Overall, the New Trent iTorch is an excellent way to extend battery life when a charger may not be accessible. The extended battery pack is extremely easy to operate and packs quite a punch. I have charged my iPhone 5 off of it a couple times without needing to charge it. Once it runs out of juice, charging times are minimal while charging it off of my iPad 4 wall charger.The laser pointer is extremely bright and fun to use when playing with the pets! The flashlight could be a little brighter, but it does the job. Overall, this is an excellent solution to any battery life issues you may have. As of this review, I have not come across anything I dislike about the product. It works exactly as advertised.
1925, This product deserves five stars because it delivers what it was made for: Charge!Pros:It holds a great amount of charge; it charges fast and it comes with everything you need. And it has a nice, cool, elegant and sturdy design.Cons:None so far.Applications:You will be able to charge any USB chargeable gadget; I've use it to charge my iPhone; giving me more talk time throughout my day, my kids iPod and iPad mini to give them a longer boost when need it, my Canon camera to keep taking pictures and videos of my son's Baseball games and practices, and now my son's new RC helicopter which comes with a USB cable so don't have to use the remote to charge it. And as an extra, it comes with a led light and laser beam to help in the dark and/or daylight. This gadget its pretty handy.
1926, This was it!  2Pac's greatest CD ever was definitely All Eyez On Me!  The only other Pac album that comes close is Makaveli. Right off the bat,  Pac hits you with Ambitionz Az A Ridah, a song you will definitely rewind  again and again! Once you get past that, it's a simply superb ride! No one  can deny the power and emotion Pac brings on No More Pain. With Devante  from Jodeci producing, this track is mind blowing. The hard bass will pound  through any system, and the listener will definitely be put in a trance.  One of the hidden jewels on this CD is Tradin' War Stories, which features  one of the West Coast's most slept on rappers, C-BO. He and a few other  guest artists help Pac nail this one down. This is definitely a CD to have.  All true Pac fans know that this is his best work. I recommend this to  everyone. This definitely deserves five stars.
1927, As in most great space stories, this story has a rich background in science and a detailed development of the characters. There are more than just a few characters and relationships to follow to keep it interesting. It is a believable story of the future, almost like an advanced history. The unfolding of the characters and character relationships are a pleasure to read. The story continues to roll along at a good pace without being bogged down with too many extraneous details. For the multiplexer, it is a story that you can break away from periodically and are always glad to pick back up. Red Mars makes you think about the exploration of pristine environments and the politics of changing such environments. I have yet to complete the RED Mars story, but already have plans to read the full trilogy.
1928, This is quite ingenious!  I don't know if any other manufacturers have them, but they are such a great idea.  Instead of a hole there is a slot in the top.  Around the side are the marks I,II and III.  You line up the marks with the baby's nose and that dictates how fast the flow of milk is. This teat allows a thicker liquid to flow through so you can add rice or another cereal of your choice if you need to.  My baby is in the 90th percentile and at 8 weeks old Milk just wasn't enough.  I put 1 tablespoon of rice in with 4 ounces of milk initially and then later on increased that to 2 tablespoons (all with doctor's approval).  It is a much thicker liquid but flowed through this teat easily.  I highly recommend these.
1929, The tag-less feature is a thick plastic iron on label, that at first seems very flexible, but as the t shirt wears and the cotton shrinks......the label that is permanently glued to the inside of the neck doesn't shrink, so the t shirt starts to get distorted in that area, actually making the tag-less feature even more bothersome on the neck than a normal tag that I could just cut off.Until they change the design of the tag-less label to something different, I will not be auditioning these shirts for my everyday go to t shirt. I'm looking to buy 20 shirts.......all same brand and size of course.This shirt wont be it.
1930, I'm a fairly tall guy, but very long in the torso, so most shirts have a tendency to untuck themselves.  I can find dress shirts long enough, but the typical undershirt has a tendency to slip out and then bunch at the beltline.These shirts are long, long enough to stay tucked in all day.  The cotton is on the thin side, which is fine because I'm not looking for insulation.  The biggest thing for me is the neckband - too often manufacturers will use a bad seam on the neckband, creating a spot that rubs, or they use those awful tags that itch.  These shirts have neither - the neckband seems to be a single piece (or has a very nice stitching job) and there is no tag.  No itching, no chafing.  So, affordable and comfortable T-shirts?  Yeah, that's 5 stars.
1931, Read some of the other reviews that explain the 100-song, 20-playlist limits (those reviews are very helpful).  If you create playlists to transfer the songs, you can sync many, many songs.  The movies won't sync - I would definitely purchase the full version if those would transfer, but hey - Apple is pretty selfish.  I didn't rate it a full 5 because there are almost no labels for many of the buttons and actions, so much of it is trial and error.  The good thing is that you won't accidentally delete a playlist or easily alter sort options, etc.  All in all, a really good app if you are looking to get your iPod music to your Kindle.
1932, This has the best of the singles Diana released in the 70's and early 80's.  My favorite tracks are &quot;I'm Coming Out&quot; and &quot;Upside Down&quot;.  They are timeless dance tracks that will always get you  moving.  I think they are the best thing Diana did after leaving the  Supremes.  &quot;Theme From Mahogany&quot; and &quot;Touch Me In The  Morning&quot; haven't stood the test of time as well but are always a joy  to hear and are my favorite ballads on the album.
1933, I purchased two of these tools for snow and ice scraping and just when I thought we were finished with all that, I went to my car early in the morning and had to scrape ice.This tool works great.  It feels sturdy, does not scratch the window.  It is very easy to hold and reached most of the front window of my SUV, which is good for me on a cold, snowy morning, especially when I am on the way to the gym in my gym shorts.  Yikes.Definitely a recommended buy.  Price was really good and free shipping is a plus.
1934, This series is surprisingly good since the premise and the characters could easily make it simply formulaic. Here's my one criticism: if you're going to write a crime series which supposedly takes place in SE Florida given the constant reference to the Everglades, try checking a map and a few facts now and then. Too many sloppy references to cities on the west coast of FL as if they are right next door. Also, the episode about the hurricane is ludicrous. A high school reunion during a hurricane? A category 2 storm causing the type of wind damage portrayed?  Fact checking helps with credibility.
1935, I've always loved everything from Disney. I grew up watching the great classic movies, along with this and some other Sing-Along videos as well. This was one of those VHS tapes I would watch over and over again when I was younger. I'm almost 20 years old and I still enjoy it from time to time, as cheesy and outdated as it is reeking to the early 90's. I bought the DVD for my twin cousins a couple years ago as a present for their first Christmas and they loved it (they watch "Mickey Mouse Clubhouse" all the time, so naturally this was a winner). I was happy to show them something I enjoyed at their age
1936, I really really like this gate. My 19 year old grandson put it up for me as a means of keeping our dog limited to a certain area of our house, and to keep the grandkids in a more controlled area as well. It was easy to install and so far seems to be holding up very well. My only concern is whether it will last over time because we get so much traffic in our house and you do have to use a good bit of &#34;push&#34; to release and open the gate each time.  But overall, at this point, we love it!
1937, By far my favorite Tom Clancy book. The origins of John Clark are revealed in this underappreciated novel. You get to climb inside his personal motivations, witness his Navy Seal inspired tactics and see how he becomes a black operative working with the CIA as it carries over into later books. Clancy gives you the details, from jury rigged weapons to the psychology of a former soldier with the skills to kill but nowhere to practice them. The story is short on action but long on depth of character. I can see why it wouldn't do as well as a movie but for the sake of fun reading this may be his best work.
1938, No one on earth is as picky about shirts as my husband.  I'm serious.  The man is meticulous about grooming, hygiene, and keeping our home neat and orderly.  But he will wear a shirt he loves until it has holes as big as the neck.  So I bought this for him because he was catching a draft.  I'm not kidding!Nice quality, and we're very happy with the fit.  He wears size L, but I bought size XL in this shirt because he wears long sleeve t-shirts for lounging in the winter.  He won't wear fleece shirts, and he told me he was having a hard time finding long sleeve t-shirts in stores.  So I bought this, and ta-da!  He likes it, and I'm pleased with it.  Wash and dry, comes out nice.
1939, Saw a similar shoe in White House Black Market in the Spring, but didn't buy it.  When I went back, the shoe was gone, but that's alright ... it was over $100 there ...  Saw this shoe on line for less than half the price, and it was Bandolino, a great brand.  Got the shoe in time to take on an AK cruise, and I'm in love ...  Shoe is very comfortable and well worth the money.  I would highly recommend this shoe to anyone who is looking for a classic look and comfortable shoe!
1940, A very-well documented history of the Beatles first trip to the US! Surprisingly, the video and audio are very good for being over 35 years old. Although I'm not a fan of MPI Home Video's quality from what I've seen  so far, this is one of the better ones (although they didn't Q/A the trivia  game). Beatles fans need this -- and so do all fans of music history --  'cuz this is it: almost an hour and a half of the real-life Beatles, their  humor, their charm, and their wonderful music.
1941, I ordered a pair and it arrived quickly in about 3-4 days with standard shipping. These pants are warm, thick and strong. They had the exact size I needed and the price was fair. Also they are nice looking pants which I can wear to work or anywhere else. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality. I've bought pants similar to these in local stores at similar prices. However, the store bought pants were not as thick and durable as these. I highly recommend these pants and I will definitely order more pairs in the future. The quality here is excellent.
1942, Without having gotten the DVD yet, and after reading someone else's comment. All that I have to say is that is a shame they edited all the climbing scene during Cry/The Electric Co.Those who have watched or listen to bootlegs concerts from the early days, know that climbing until the top of the stage was the part of the show that excite the crow the most. Bono and his famous stunts that ended on a fight in a LA show back in 1983.About the grainy stuff. C'omon, cameras were not the same back in 1983 and who had thought back them that we would have DVD and LCD tvs now in 2008.
1943, I recently had to replace my Rain-X wiper blades. While I was initially impressed with the quality of the wiping on those blades, I find it pretty annoying to pay a price premium only to have them 1# not securely fit my wiper arm and #2 last only 6 months at best.These Bosch blades are nothing short of fantastic! At the current price they are about on par, on price only, to the Rain-X. You can't ask for a more secure fit on your wiper arm. You also can't ask for a more solid, complete clean wipe from a wiper blade. I was amazed by the Rain-X when I first got them. Over time, not so much. With these Bosch blades, they are just as impressive 3 months on as they were the day I put them on.When I'm in the market for wiper blades next, this is where I'm heading first, assuming they last more than 6 months (still have ~45 days before then).Highly recommended.
1944, This show about intelligence annalists might seem dull to some, but as someone that served long years in the military it resonated with me.  The personal interactions of the characters made it move slow, but I think the acting was good enough to pull it off.  I couldn't help thinking of what it might have been like if I had tried for a position in military intelligence years ago.  It also made me think of what it must have been like to be an intelligence annalist in the time leading up to the Iraq wars.  I do wish they had time for at least a few more episodes as the ending seems too condensed.  Would have loved it  if they could have continued on for a second year, but these shows cost money and sponsors today want cheaper entertainment for the masses like &#34;reality TV&#34;,
1945, This video deserves 10 stars. From the dancing, which Tina choreographed herself, to the songs, which Tina sang with so much vibrant energy, everyhting stands out beautifuly. This is the video for Tina's amazing  Foreign Affair tour in early 1990. At the time Tina was fifty years old but  you couldn't tell if you looked with a microscope. Tina delivers an soulful  Typical Male, a song which I think is not among her best, but in this video  it shines. Also this is the last video, still available in the US, that has  Let's Stay Together. Anothert thing which I loved about this video is  Tina's face, from smiling to bursting with pure soul; it's amazing.
1946, I use my fitness pal daily to log my food and exercise. Because so many other people use it there are not many foods I have put into the app that were not already on the app. I like that if you have the nutritional information about a food you can verify its accuracy. I also like that you can put a brand or store into the search box and often find what you are looking for. at the end of the day the app will tell you what you work most likely weigh in 5 weeks if everyday was like that day. the app will also warn you if you do not consume enough calories on a given day. I like that the app syncs between computer and kindle seamlessly.
1947, After watching the preview for this film I thought it looked promising.  It turns out to be rather typical and generally disappointing.  It's really just a bunch of fight scenes broken up by A LOT of running.  There's really not much of a plot.  If you're interested in watching this movie I would just save yourself the $7 and read one or two of the favorable reviews; you will get at least as much storyline as the movie gives.  This is one of those movies that looks like it could have been good but it just fell short.  Don't waste your money.
1948, wow- it works great- well the first few times I have used it. biting nails is super hard to break. I am on the 3rd bottle (over like 5 yrs) so hopefully this time it will work for me (again). warning- don't touch anything with your hands after applying for like 24 hrs. especially not Thanksgiving Day biscuits everyone else would (have liked to) eat. It kind of gets over everything you touch and then put in your mouth. and unless you have some tolerance to it (like I do now...) then well it can be really unpleasant.I am sure it would be best to break your kid of the habit before they ruin dinner at a later age....
1949, First and foremost, Rick James was a dynamite producer who had an obvious affinity for Sly & the Family Stone, Graham Central Station and Parliament/Funkadelic, but also understood how to easily swim in the mainstream.But taking all that into account, the key to the songs was James throwing catchy hooks the way heavyweight champ "Smokin'" Joe Frazier could unleash the left variety in the ring. Super Freak and Give It To Me Baby are clubland classics - extended-play versions are also included on disk one - but nit to be overlooked are incredible tracks like Mr. Policeman, Ghetto Life and Below The Funk (Pass The J).The second disk is live "punk funk," with James in full flight and at the top of creative/performance powers. This is an excellent collection that clearly shows the timeless energy from one of the best releases in the 1980s.
1950, This is great. Every single Marvin Gaye hit spanning from 1962 up until his death in 1984, including five he did with Tammi Terrell. Gaye was one of the finest soul singers ever, maybe the best ever. His 1968 recording &quot;I Heard It Through The Grapevine&quot; is one of the finest performances in recording history. It sends chills up your spine every time. There are too many hits to mention. Every one of them is here. Outstanding and Essential!Gaye was one of those very special talends like Elvis, in which his fame and legend were so great, no one could tell them what to do, and ultimately that was his downfall. Great sound and at a great price!
1951, Most people change their motor oil regularly, but forget about the transmission fluid. I have a few collectible cars. I only use Royal Purple products. They are fully synthetic, not a BLEND like some others, and they have a great web site where you can find the EXACT fluid for your car's transmission. so many people use the wrong fluids. The transmission should last as long as your engine. The wrong fluid or not changing the fluid will ruin your transmission. I have used syhthetic fluids on my Toyota Camry for twenty years. It's a 1990. Still the same engine and automatic transmission. I also use synthetic power steering and break fluid which I change every year. That's why I use it on my other cars as well. Just be sure to check their site to be sure you are using the right fluid for your vehicle. That is a MUST!
1952, Primo claims that the &#34;Eurobath is the only bath tub you'll ever need&#34;. It might just be true!When our LO was born, we started with one of the smaller standard bathtub with a net. It was ok while we used the net but quickly became uncomfortable for our LO. Now that we've tried it, we wish we'd have gotten the Eurobath right from the start.PROS:- Fits in our standard bath tub- Can be hanged (we use a Command hook)- Keeps baby comfy and safe for months on the &#34;baby&#34; side (at 7 months old, 18 lbs and over 28&#34;, our LO still uses the &#34;baby side&#34;)- There seems to be lots of space on the other side for when we're ready for it- Empties fast and easily- Actually saves water because it's so wide that there's no water loss when filling from the tub spout- No mold issues- Baby loves it!CONS:Haven't found any yet.
1953, This show has one interesting character. The rest are freaking boring, which is a shame because the premise is pretty cool. Why cast such uninteresting actors? And why are the characters so poorly written? The plot line is quality work, but for what is basically supposed to be a police procedural the &#34;cops&#34; spend half of every episode complaining, and the other half fighting and sulking. The  lead cop brings her ex onto the team, who sits through most of the pilot. (Sulking.) Then in a later episode they have a fight about her keeping things from him and for the rest of that episode he sulks and ignores her calls.(The calls of the lead investigator during a case involving the possible murder of a woman.) Because he is her ex she does not have him removed from the team, but tries to make up. So very irritating. I keep wanting to shout at the characters to grow the f up.
1954, I read lots of reviews before purchasing this monitor. My grand daughter is now 11 months old and I watch her during the day while her parents are at work. During the day she takes two naps. She always wakes happy but before the monitor I did not hear her until she cried. Now I am able to clearly hear when she wakes and begins playing with her crib toys and am able to respond before she becomes stressed. Also I know exactly when she drifts off to sleep. There is occasional static but it is very low. My daughter-in-law spent a lot more money for something not nearly as good. In my opinion for the money this is the absolute best product on the market hands down.
1955, This is one of the "handiest" external battery chargers I have seen on the market. Not only does it complete two full charge cycles on the iPhone and the Samsung Galaxy S2 and one full charge on the Kindle Fire, but it is designed to comfortably fit in the palm of your hand. The LED flashlight is a nice added touch and the laser pointer is great when making presentations. It would be even better if it had an additional 2.1 amp port, but this might effect the "handiness" of the design if it increased the thickness and weight of the device. As it is designed now, I am able to hold both the iTorch and my smartphone in the palm of my hand while charging. Overall, this is a "must have" for all smart phone users.
1956, My son is 9 months old and could be bathed in our regular bath tub without issues. However, bathing him in the tub kills my back! We have been using this tub on our kitchen counter since he was born and its the best thing. I can bathe him at a comfortable height without bending and kneeling. Now that he sits well unsupported he would rather sit, which this tub allows. But when he was a newborn he was able to lie down and be well supported. I think this tub is wonderful. It is large and spacious and I think it could easily be used well into the toddler years. My only complaint is the drain. We have to put a plastic spoon in the hole to keep it open, otherwise the water pressure pushes the plug shut while it's draining. Other than that, I absolutely love this and would recommend it to anyone who doesn't want to awkwardly bathe their child in the regular tub.
1957, Well I'm a big fan of the movie, and I got it on DVD a couple years back. Recently I purchased a new copy at HMV and when I played it... IT WAS A HORRIBLE DVD!!!! The audio is horrible. I.E. At the end of the movie, when the reprise of the the title track is played It's original note is supposed to be E. but on the DVD, It's Eb! The picture is horrible, it's all grainy and washed out. I.E. In the Resturant scene, the spaghetti looks like lettuce and nachos. So all in all, you're better off getting the VHS. it has better picture and sound.
1958, Wish I could use the scanner feature but my kindle doesn't allow.  Would be better for someone with the app on their phone.  But overall a great app.  It really made me aware of how much junk I was really eating everyday and how many calories I was really taking in.  Have used for 4 weeks straight and lost 7 pounds (my goal was 1 lb per week) just by walking everyday and being dilligent about entering and watching what I have eaten for the day.  This app is for someone that is serious about losing weight.  I have had this app for a while, but until recently was not taking tracking my intake seriously to lose the weight.
1959, I'll make this as short as possible...........like I wish the book would have been.  This read was easily twice as long as it needed to be.  I got halfway through, and quit.  It was so boring.  I wanted, (as always), a good story, not a tedious dialog that goes on and on about every little detail involved in colonizing a planet.  I can't believe this author is receiving accolades for this work.  He can, in no way, be compared to any of the greats in the sci-fi field.
1960, This greatest hits collection offers nine Toto "classics" plus four previously unreleased tracks.  Conspicuously absent are songs like "Make Believe," "I'll Supply the Love" and "Stranger in Town."  Overall, its a decent representation of the band's finer moments, thumbing its nose at its harshest critics.  The four new songs sound a little too Michael Jackson-ish to my liking, one (CAN YOU HEAR WHAT I'M SAYING) even feels like a Police cover.  One can't deny, however, the tremendous musical skills evinced by Toto.  Their Grammy winning AFRICA and ROSANNA are included, as well as the smoky, heartfelt OUT OF LOVE, their early hits HOLD THE LINE and 99 are memorable entries as well as their great ballads I WON'T HOLD YOU BACK and I'LL BE OVER YOU.I've always enjoyed Toto--they're astounding musicians and even at their worst, they far surpass most of what's out there now!
1961, For us this is a LIFE SAVER!!... It has been really helpfull... I even bought another one for my mother's house... Im agree with a lot of nice stuff from other reviews and Im not going to repeat them, but I have to say something about how many times it gets full.  It's not true that it gets full everyday.... or.... It would get full if you put the diapers open.... What you have to do is Fold the diaper together with the wipes that you use, and you would see the difference... I use to change it every 2 days, now It gets full every 4 days.... The refills are not expensive at all, and you could always get free refills at Babies R Us, buying 2 or 3 together....I use one refill every 3 weeks or so....I haven't try any other one in the market, but for me this is perfect, so I could say that is the BEST OPTION!!!
1962, I used this bathtub from the day I brought my son home until he was old enough to climb out of it on his own. When he was really tiny we just put a rolled up waschloth at his groin to prop him up a bit more. But it was so nice that he could be supported but be deeper in the water. He stayed warmer and he was much more relaxed than when we bathed him in the standard baby tub at my parents house. As he got older we were able to let him splash and kick and explore so much more because the back is so supportive. Yes, it is a little large, but it has a drain in the bottom and we just stored it in the regular bathtub when we werent showering. Recommend it to all my moomy-to-be friends.
1963, This tub is VERY VERY large. It is too big to fit in my sink so I must put it on the countertop to bathe my 3 week old or be subject to putting it into my bathtub which is hard on my back. It also has very high sides so it is very difficult to reach into it to bathe him; even though I am 5' 8". I had a smaller tub for my daughter which fit very well in my sink (sure comfort deluxe) but I had lost the net which is required for a newborn so that's the only reason why I purchased this one (it got very good reviews). I am going to go back to the sure comfort deluxe tub once my son has better control over his movements. I am very suprised that this tub got such great reviews because of the size of it. My son is lost in it.
1964, After reading other reviews on this shoe, I did go with a wide instead of a medium width.  My experience in the past with LifeStride shoes is that they do run narrow.  So, the wide width is a perfect medium for me.  These sandals are comfortable, nice looking and easy to put on and take off.  The soles are non-skid and they wipe off readily.  I would have given them a 5 star rating except that the width has to be adjusted up, which the average new customer would not know without reading the product reviews.
1965, A brilliant rendition on the Stargate theme, Universe,-Not unlike Terminator: The Sarah Chronicles-burned with an emotional flame thats just out ofspectrum with the folks mainlining their T.V.People seem to have difficulty when conflict andprogression are described in more than 10 emotional states.I'm going to leave he last episode unwatched andadd the suggestion as I did with the Terminatorfranchise- Not that much time has passed and theactors can still pick up without a hitch. Do it.Hell, I'd produce it. Or at least Book It from the endof the show which for me continues on paper...
1966, I gained almost 100 pounds on my method of birth control, and I knew I HAD TO LOSE IT. I'm positive this app will help. With this you put in your weight, goal weight, height, and some other info, and it'll TELL you what your daily calorie count should be at to meet your goal. Put your food in (I do find their food library a bit lacking), and it'll keep up with your calories, you can even put in how much/what kind of excersize you did that day! It also has right up there with your calorie count how many calories left you can consume until you're at your daily limit. I love this app!
1967, OEM quality, as mentioned, made in Japan.  The only gripe is the OEM cap has Honda screws that are have washer locks on them to keep them on the cap and thus less likely to drop while removing them.  The replacement screws are separate.  The cap also comes with a replacement gasket.TIP:  Always replace plug wires one at a time from the old cap to the new cap in the same order/rotation you pull from.May as well replace the rotor and coil while you are at it:Beck Arnley  173-7988  Ignition RotorOEM 5100A Ignition Coil
1968, First off, I really appreciate the fact that these bottles are made of glass, as opposed to plastic. We try to limit food and beverages consumed in plastic. These aren't fancy and are a great price. You can skip the 4oz bottles and just get a bunch of 8oz ones. Your child will eventually use just the 8oz ones and in the mean time, you can just fill them up with 4oz.While they are great, the rings and nipples may need to be replaced. They are not expensive though, so it's not a huge problem. Our daughter however did not like these as much as the Playtex drop ins. She really had a hard time sucking them. She would have to stop drinking and we would have to wait for all of the air to flow back in before she could continue. Maybe we just had faulty nipples. I'm not sure. I would be willing to give them another try though with our next child.
1969, Fits the Databank (I have the DB300) as advertised.  Only thing I don't like (thus minus one star) is the buckle is silver instead of black.  Nice pliable material, not stiff.  Good spacing between holes in the band where the buckle fits.Update:  After wearing this a few weeks, my arm had an allergic reaction to 'something'.  I quit wearing the watch and the reaction went away.  Started wearing the watch again and had same reaction.  Repeated this scenario one more time.  Replaced watchband with a genuine Casio band and haven't had any problems since.  Therefore, if you experience itching or swelling or redness, the band might be the problem.
1970, I've been using my headset for four months now and have loved it.  I typically use it for listening to podcasts and audio books while I'm working, and for that purpose, it works wonderfully.  I've heard the sound quality isn't so great for music, but to be honest, my hearing isn't sharp enough to tell where it's lacking.My only complaints are with actual phone calls.  I've heard from people I've called that it picks up a lot more wind and background noise that my old Voyager 510 did.  There also seems to be a bit of a delay (less than 1/4th of a second) between when I start speaking, and when the mic starts picking me up.  It's fine if I take the time to speak clearly, but tends miss short, one word replies completely.
1971, i got this tender for charging two motorcycles that i have.  i was able to fully charge a brand new battery i purchased (its recommended to charge a new motorcycle battery after adding the acid).  i like that this comes with a long enough cord so i can plug it into the outlet without moving my bike or using an extension cable.  it also comes with the clamps and adapter you can use if your battery has this for easy charging.  i used this on a shorai battery for my cbr and worked great.there are no settings to change, just attach the connection to the battery and plug it into the wall outlet and you're good to go.great tender for a good price
1972, I had a different baby tub before this because I thought this was too expensive. But my baby outgrew the one first one I bought so I ended up buying this one and I wished I bought this one in the first place!The tub is large so it holds more water. My baby loves playing in it! The newborn side of the tub is awesome. It prevents my baby from sliding.The toddler side is great too! My son enjoys sitting up and playing with his floaty toys.Don't be intimidated by the size. I have a narrow tub and was worried it wouldn't fit in it, but it fit perfectly!
1973, This iPhone made cord will work with ANY standard 3.5mm jack.  This means not only will it work with your iPhone, but will also with your Touch, Nano, Classic and what not.  This means this cord will work with any of the current audio devices you have that have a standard 3.5mm jack.  The only difference between the input jack on the iPhone and any other MP3 player is that the iPhone jack is deeper, more recessed in than normal.  Cord is well constructed and very sturdy.  I use it in my Camry and the sound is excellent.
1974, London Hospital is a real place and the cases presented during the episodes are drawn from hospital records and newspaper articles of the time. Of course there are romantic and plot embellishments, but good acting in general weaves them seamlessly into the narrative.  This was a critical time not only medically in terms of discoveries (e.g. infectious processes and anesthesia) but also socially.  London's East End was a boiling melting pot of displaced eastern Europeans and anarchists.  Grinding poverty shored up the booming Victorian society and economy at a terrible price.  The London Hospital and its stories reflect the human cost.Well written, well acted... forgive the occasional General Hospital soap bubble.
1975, We had a pretty big newborn (9lbs) so this worked really well for us.  I think I would be scared to put a baby littler than that in it though.  It is a HUGE tub.  If you don't plan on keeping it in the tub all the time...get a different tub.  I'm glad I have a basement because storing it anywhere else would be a pain.But the size is one of the reasons I love it too.  Son really likes kicking and splashing around in it and I feel he is very secure in there.  I love the little sections to put his shampoo and soap as well.  I love the little "out spout" it has too to empty it.
1976, This item works, believe it or not.  Read the instruction on the label first, cleaned both front and rear windshield glasses with Windex and paper towels.  Applied this treatment in circular motion from one side to the other.  Then used a clean paper towel to wipe off the light frost it became.  And off you go.  Today, with shower on freeway doing 65mph without wiper in use, the rain just beads away in faster speed and bigger drops never seen before, and noticed to my even bigger surprise is that when the wiper is on, the previous bothersome wiper noises are absolutely gone.  This thing makes me happen, one hand it increases the visibility in rainy days, on the other it conditions the windshield so wipers work more noise-free and precisely.  best eight bucks ever spent on a car care item, this one is 5 stars in my book.  Absolutely highly recommended for every discerning driver.
1977, Lighter weight than I thought it would be. So it shouldn't wear you out just wearing it.Had good quality seams but would like more rows of stitch for work grade use.6' and it was right height with boots.Over the shoulder chest release is lighter weight and ok to operate.False fly in front and fabric wasn't laying flush drawing attention.Two chest pockets with solid secure snaps.Plenty pockets and generous side hand pockets.If you have a broad chest you may want to order larger size than normal. 36-38&#34; waist 52&#34; chest. I ordered 38&#34; and was snug at handle and rib area causing awkward securing of eye/buttons at waist.Would recommend this to Light to Medium weight work duty.
1978, I have to give this lotion five stars because it's the only body lotion that I've found is gentle enough to also use on my face and neck. I put it on at night and after showers, and it's kept my skin in great shape (no breaking out like I usually do from other body lotions). It's light but still moisturizing, and isn't like other body lotions that are heavy with scent or feel too thick to slather on your cheeks. This is my go-to lotion for everywhere: the gaps between your toes, behind your ears, and your elbows. It'll moisturize everything just the right amount.Be warned: there is a scent! It's not too strong, but if you prefer hypoallergenic lotions, this may not be for you.When I say it moisturizes everywhere, I mean to say it's a daily moisturizer. Don't expect this to heal your puffy eyes or hydrate your chapped winter skin.
1979, I've used my Yaktrax maybe 10 times, 4 of them were when I was running. They were great at first, helped me not slip on most ice (still slick on certain surfaces), and I could run in them. But last time I ran I noticed that two of the elastic bands snapped, same band on both.I'm thinking it was caused by one or two things:I take them off my shoes almost every time since I use them on both my hiking boots and my running shoes, I'm thinking that could have given the metal spirals to shift a bit and pinch the elastic band.The last time I ran on them I would say it was clean cement 70% of the time and ice and snow the other 30%, so another possibility is the rough cement caused the elastic to fray easier.Will definitely buy heavier duty ones next time.
1980, FINALLY HAD OUR BABY AND GOT TO TRY IT OUT..THE FIRST TIME I HOOKED IT UP WAS WHEN I RECIEVED IT, I DID HEAR THE NEIGHBORS MONITOR A LITTLE..BUT ALMOST ALL BABY MONITORS WILL HAVE THAT PROB. UNLESS YOU WANT TO SPEND ALOT OF $..BUT THIS HAS 2 CHANNELS TO CHOOSE FROM.. SO JUST SWITCH IT..THAT SIMPLE..I HAVE HAD IT ON FOR LAST FEW DAYS AND WORKS PERFECT..VERY SENSITIVE, AND ALMOST NO HISSING OR BUZZING AT ALL.. AND DOESNT NEED TO BE TURNED UP VERY LOUD..JUST SET IT RIGHT NEXT TO THE CRIB ON A TABLE....VERY HAPPY WITH IT
1981, I only recently discovered Foyle's War. A unique look at police work in England during World War II. Cast and character development was excellent. An engrossing tale, each episode almost a stand-alone show in itself. Like a real page-turner of a book, this will keep you occupied until the very end. Having just finished the final episode in series 6, I can only say that I am really disappointed that there are no more episodes at this time. I could watch this show from now on. Foyle's War certainly has earned its 5-star rating from this old man.
1982, I make custom T shirts and other clothing items like this locally. I order everything from a specific place but sometimes i will order single pieces from amazon when someone places order shortly after i already made my weekly- 2 week clothing purchase for orders. The price is great because my supplier would charge 10 bucks shipping on my order if it isn't over a certain amount so here i just pay 2.00 more and still have a good turn around time on my products (: which is what i strive for! My customers love this brand, I personally don't like hoodies because of the tightness around neck but i wear them anyways and cut a little slit at the neckline...i prefer sweatshirts and they have those in this brand too which is great and a variety of colors to choose from.
1983, Red Mars is a very detailed, sprawling look at realistic Mars colonization. I did not find it to be a quick read. There were areas of this novel that really picked up the pace, while other areas dragged some due to the expert detail. Although it's uneven, it's still a fine book and recommended. In the end, the big story is Tolkien-esque, but with a SF skin.Still, reading this today, I didn't feel that this came out in 1993. Robinson has quite the talent for creating a realistic future.
1984, This tub is great. Very well designed and extremely well made.  My son is very big for his age and yet still fits in it really well.  It is very sturdy and yet is light to carry and as our bathroom is quite small is hung on the wall out of the way when not in use.  It fits well in the large family bathtub but also on the worktop next to the sink when my back is too sore to lean over the bath.  The small plug is very easy to use too and means you can drain a little water to top it up if you need to.  I love the fact that as he gets older he can sit up at the other end and I won't have to use so much water as the large family bathtub for him for quite some time. I haven't seen a better bath anywhere.
1985, For an opera film in 1968, this is a vivid performance, both artistically and techno-electronically.  This film is all about Anna, with a supporting cast which is more than adequate.  How can any red blooded male, or even female, not fall in love or at least sympathize with this Violetta?  The lips are mumbling, but voluminous music spew out of those lungs.  This shortcoming is easily forgiven.  I don't mind the lip-synch, given the beautiful music extolled by the performers.  The bottom line about this film:  Anna Moffo is Anna Moffo !!
1986, Does a very good job at keeping the battery fully charged  Using the  included cigarette lighter connection works very well.  Quality made.Update 1-30-2010 Upgrade to 5 stars *****Had this unit in operation for over 18 MONTHS now and still working just fine.  I use it to keep the two (2) batteries in my 06 Chevy diesel truck charged.  The truck is only used to tow my RV so 10 months out of the past year the truck sits stored.  (My 08 Malibu gets 33 mpg truck 20mpg mpg hwy WHEN NOT TOWING)  The charger/maintainer has been constantly in use.Update: December 2010:  Unit in constant use for yet another year and still works fine.  10 stars!!!
1987, It must be very difficult to write 1000 pages where nothing important happens. Possibly this is why it took 5 years for MARTIN to write the book. Aside from the obvious lack of plot,internal inconsistances are everywhere One of the most obvious is Daenerys'once invincible army is now for no reason, powerless. New characters are intoduced by the dozens for no apparent purpose other then filling pages. Old characters you do care about are ignored or killed off,again for no apparent reason other then filling up pages.Every book even those in a series should stand on its own, this book does not rise to that level. It is filler plain and simple, often well written but filler nonetheles.All and all a disservice to his many readers
1988, I have had several pair of these in the last 25 years or so.  These are so comfy, no break in time required.  I'd like to see more fashion colors, though.  I'd love to have pairs in turquoise, bright yellow, orange, kelly green, hot pink, etc.  I wear these with slacks and tailored skirts, even certain dresses. They are very soft and comfy, durable, and make your foot look very small.  I can't recommend them strongly enough to anyone who needs to be on thier feet a great deal, or who has foot problems, or who simply wants a sturdy-but-stylish walking shoe.
1989, There's not much more to say about this wonderful jazz CD that hasn't already been touched on in previous comments. The title track is Grover Washington Jr.'s signature piece and the accompanying three compositions are fine compliments to "Mr. Magic". "Earth Tones" is a percussive, gritty number with a driving uptempo rhythm, followed by the dreamy, mellow "Passion Flower". The title track is Grover Washington Jr.'s signature piece, a punchy jazz/pop fusion that always delivers. "Black Frost" is another groovy number which closes out the CD. Even though the program consists of just four tracks, the music creates a nice atmosphere to relax and enjoy a master performing at the top of his game. Grover Washington Jr.'s music will endure forever.
1990, This kept the Tinea Versicolcor at bay more so than eradicating it. I do think that combined with prescribed products this aided tremendously in my finally getting rid of the skin discoloration. The only setback is the smell. It may have been that my PH just didn't mesh well with it, but it had a strong medicinal smell that forced me to use it only before bed, instead of during the day as I would have liked.Despite the smell I am likely going to be purchasing this again if I notice the discoloration is rearing its ugly head again.
1991, Robinson achieves a pitch perfect balance of real science and fiction in Red Mars.  The story of the 100 colonists is gripping.  From John Boone, the legend, Coyote, the mysterious stowaway and the computer-like Sax  Russell, there are characters in this read that you will not forget.  The  Drama is first class and keeps you coming back for more in the following  two books.  The revolution that occurs is really well written.  After  reading this book you will not look into the nighttime sky the same ever  again.  Red Mars may very well be a novel that is prophetic in its  depiction of the future.  I also highly recomend some music to accompany  the reading- for some good sugestions read the next review!  Enjoy!
1992, The iTorch is a fantastic addition to the the Newtrent collection. I would highly recommend it. As a tennis player, it is nice to know that I can toss the charger into my bag while its connected to my phone, so that as I play tennis, that my phone will be in the process of being charged. Or I could leave it in my car or my backpack. The point is that due to the sleek and smaller size, I can take this everywhere without worrying about the bulk of the larger capacity battery. I know my women friends would appreciate having one of these in their bags, definitely my girlfriend who always seem to be out of battery on her iphone. The addition of the laser pointer and light feature are great bonuses. I do hope that in the future there are dedicated buttons for these features. Other than that, if you need a small portable battery since you are a person that is always on the go. I would highly definitely pick this battery up.
1993, What's Going On is not only Marvin Gaye's masterpiece but its also a very moving album, and is one of the greatest albums ever created. Song topics range from damaged war veterans(What's Happening Brother) to the drug addiction of, "Flyin High(In The Freindly Sky)", to religion, "God Is Love", and finally a damaged ecology, "Mercy Mercy Me(The Ecology)". Each and every song in here contains Marvin Gaye's beatufil singing voice that sounds like it came from his soul. Also on a lot of the songs there are very beautiful string arrangements that makes songs sound like they come from the soul and heart. What's Going On is the essential album for any music lover because its just one of the those albums that really moves you. All in all if you dont own What's Going On I'd advise you to pick up a copy today if you want to hear an album that will change your life.
1994, I have two of these changing pad covers and used them both for a year with my first child. They are mediocre. I noticed that the material frayed around the elastic after a few months of use. I stitched them back up, but it looks kind of cruddy and the material continues to unravel in new places. I agree with one of the other comments regarding a slit for the safety strap...one is not present. Finally, I used it with the changing pad by "Especially for Baby" and the fit was a bit too tight which resulted in the pad curving a bit over time.For a few more dollars, I would strongly recommend looking at Pottery Barn Kids' chamois pad covers. They are extrememly soft (you'll wish your sheets were made out of this stuff!), have the safety strap slits and fit the changing pad perfectly.
1995, My son has been nail biting since before he was one year old.  He is three now and after the first week of using this product his nails are growing and look fantastic.  I have noticed in about three day this product wears off and he reverts back to the biting. Since this habit didn't start overnight, I expect it to take some time to break completely. I was skeptical before trying this product but now I strongly recommend it. I finally can see there is light at the end of the tunnel for my little nail biter.
1996, Like all women have, I've tried the expensive name brand age-defying creams, cleansers, lotions, etc., but NONE of them have produce any results except the Olay Regenerist line.  I wear this Enhancing Lotion with UV protection every day under my makeup, and alone when I don't wear makeup.  It's great for any kind of skin, and especially sensitive or for people with allergies like myself.  The wrinkles are less noticeable, and that's something that I could NOT say about the Estee Lauder and Clinique lines that I used for so long; I got tired of paying so much money for NO results!Ladies, once you start using this line of Olay's, you will never go back to the department stores.
1997, I love Michael's motown years. First of all, this is the only comprehensive compilation that summarizes Michael's years at Motown. There are 44-hits that spread over 2 discs. Not only does it have his solo hits, but it also has those Jackson 5 hits. It's a great addition to your Michael Jackson collection. One of my favorites on this collection is &quot;Got To Be There&quot;. It also has a lot of unknown songs like &quot;Happy&quot;, &quot;Cinderella Stay Awhile&quot;, and &quot;One Day In Your Life&quot;. The booklet has a lot of liner notes and rare pictures. Buy this in addition to Jackson 5-Ultimate Collection.
1998, I am a huge fan of Monk's music, but the footage used in this documentary came toward the end of his performing career, and Monk comes off as inarticulate and strange. The songs are great, but sound better of course on his CD's. The consensus seems to be that Thelonius was a manic-depressive, (now called bipolar disorder) although those actual terms are not used in the comments by his adult son or his former agent or bandmates. Something was wrong, however, with his mood control and his grasp on reality in his later years. I suppose this product is better than having no film at all of such a fascinating artist, but the 90 minutes really does not educate us much as to how and why TM created his jazz piano compositions or choose to play in such a unique style. I had high expectations before I sat down to view this film, and found myself getting bored halfway through. I suggest letting his recordings speak for him, instead of these film clips.
1999, That's 105 stars.  Yeah, this is the greatest cd of all time, no matter what type of music.  This is the greatest mc of all time on his best ever cd.  There isn't a song on here that I wouldn't put among the greatest tracks of all time.  He has features from the Outlawz, Snoop Dogg, Method Man, Redman, KCi &amp; JoJo, and others.  Like I said, all the tracks crack, but the top five are Ambitions Az A Ridah, 2 of Americaz Most Wanted, Picture Me Rollin, When We Ride, and Life Goes On.  If you don't have this, go get it, I don't care if it's 2 in the morning and you gotta break into Sam Goody to jack it.  GO GET IT NOW!!!!!!!
